IF I was not a slave to my promise, I should not write to you, at present, as I find myself utterly incapable of expressing the mixed sensation of my mind. I have often complained of the inadequateness of language, but never felt it more strongly, than now; the most copious that I am acquainted with, could by no means afford you even an idea of  the different reflections that have progressively given place to each other, in the space of eight and forty hours.    I am provoked at this natural incapacity of conveying my sentiments to you; words are but a cloak, or rather a clog, to our ideas; there should be no curtain before the hearts of friends; and the longing I have ever felt for an intuitive converse, is to me a strong argument for a future state What says my sceptical friend to this opinion? Don't be alarmed, I am not going to sermonize but what is almost as dull, to narrate.  By the carelesness or ignorance of my postilion, who drove me at least a dozen miles out of my road, over Salisbury Plain, it was near midnight before I reached this place. You, who are thoroughly acquainted with the natural warmth of my temper, and know    how impatient I have been to embrace a favourite sister, after an absence of twelve years, may judge of my anxiety but there was no remedy, and I strove to amuse the irksome tediousness of my journey, by endeavouring to trace in my imagination, the growing beauties of my Emma's features, from ten years old, when I last saw the little darling of our house, to their meridian charms, at twenty-two.

At length we reached the gates of this noble edifice, and had the pleasure to find the family not retired to rest, by perceiving lights in the hall. I enquired for Sir James Desmond, as I was determined not to announce myself, and I thought it rather too late for an unknown visitor, to demand an interview with his lady I was shewn into a saloon, from whence the company had retired after supper; and from an adjacent    apartment, I heard a confused sound of voices, intermixed, with the detestable noise of a dice-box.  In a few minutes all was hushed, and a man, whom I believed to be an upper servant, was sent to reconnoitre my person, and enquire my name and business. I told him I should not reveal either, but to his master. He smiled, as it now seems, at my ignorance, and withdrew. In about ten minutes, which seemed as many hours to me, Sir James entered, with an air compounded of fierte, and timidity. I presented myself with the best grace I possibly could, and on mentioning my name, was accosted with the utmost politeness, by my brother-in-law. 
GrifMSL.txt	4	5760.0	1776	Griffith, Mrs. (Elizabeth), 1720?-1793	THE STORY OF LADY JULIANA HARLEY.	We spent a couple of hours, most agreeably, my sister became quite chearful,    Sir James and she sung two or three sweet duettos, and we all retired to rest, about three o'clock, in the most perfect harmony, and at this happy crisis I will leave you, having run my letter into too great a length, though I have a thousand things more to say to you; but I have quite as many to say to Emma, and so, Sir, you must, as in duty bound, give place to your betters; as you have gallantry enough, I hope, to agree with me, that all amiable women are so.  Adieu! C. EVELYN.        LETTER II.  CHARLES EVELYN, TO WILLIAM STANLEY.  Delville.  YOU know what an investigator of human nature I am, and yet here have I been, four whole days, and as many nights, under the same roof with Sir James Desmond, and cannot form any fixed idea of his character! one hour, tender and polite to his wife, fond of his lovely child, and easy in his manners to all around him. The next, cold, distrait, nay peevish to my sister,    insensible to the carresses of his little girl, inattentive and indifferent to his guests! help me Stanley, to account for such an opposition of qualities, and inconsistency of demeanour, in the same individual.

I am extremely pleased at the little novel, which my raillery (for indeed I    meant no more) extorted from you. Pray, at your leisure, let me have the remainder of Nancy Weston's story; I feel myself much interested for her, which is more than I ever was for Miss Morton; she always appearing to me a sort of made-up Miss, than which I know not a less amiable character.  O, Charles, if women wou'd but trust to nature for their power to charm, and scorn the mean, the treacherous auxiliary of art, how unbounded wou'd be their dominion over us! But I have not time now to expatiate on a topic, that has ever been my favourite one. For my mind is nice, tho' my moral is not severe.  I am glad to hear that Lady Juliana is grown cold and reserved to you It is at least a tacit confession that she is apprized    of your passion. No woman ventures to be disagreeably distant to a man, to whom she has once been civil, till she is quite certain that her caprice will render him unhappy. Ladies are too tenacious of their sway, to attempt an exertion of it, where it is not likely to be felt, but your true lover is the properest object in the world for tyranny, and seems really designed for no other purpose, but to be trampled on. 
GrifMSL.txt	30	5.0	1776	Griffith, Mrs. (Elizabeth), 1720?-1793	THE STORY OF LADY JULIANA HARLEY.	I found my sister alone in the drawing room, and instantly enquired for Lady Juliana she replied, with a melancholy accent, she has left us, Charles. Whither is she gone? and what cou'd be the cause of such a sudden flight? On both these subjects I am as ignorant as you can be. It is impossible, I cried; but if you ever loved me, Emma, tell me and tell me truly, have I offended Lady Juliana, and is it from my hated sight she flies? I am sure she does not hate you, she replied, for her nature is incapable of repaying hatred, for love. What, then she knows I love her? From her discourse I believe she fears you do but be composed, sit down, I beg of you Wherefore shou'd she fear it? Does she think meanly of me? My    brother was not thought unworthy her alliance, she wou'd have given her hand to him, but that her father's promise was engaged to one she never loved, but I will know the cause of her disdain; from her own lips will know it. I rang the bell and ordered my chaise to be got ready instantly. Emma burst into tears, and said, do not render me more unhappy than I am already my brother, do not leave me in distress. 
GrifMSL.txt	33	2.5	1776	Griffith, Mrs. (Elizabeth), 1720?-1793	THE STORY OF LADY JULIANA HARLEY.	  I fear then, Emma, Sewell is a knave, and joined in mean collusion with his brother, to distress your husband, who looks upon him as his friend. You are deceived, Charles, I am sure he is Sir James's friend, and mine, by his perpetually dissuading him from play. It may be so; but tell me, Emma, all you know, and all you think of Lady Juliana's sudden departure, what can it mean?  She replied, I again repeat to you, that I am as ignorant of Lady Juliana's motives for her conduct, as yourself: though to all appearance she has been perfectly blameless through the whole course of her life; her actions have always been involved in a sort of mystery, and seemingly inconsistent to my apprehension. My sister Lucy may possibly be better acquainted with her    sentiments than I am, as she was very intimate with her even before her marriage. She did not continue in that state above four months; and tho' I had reason to believe she was an unhappy wife, she lamented her husband's untimely death with such an extravagance of sorrow, as placed her very nearly on a footing with the Malabarian widows; for her health was so much impaired by her grief, that it was thought impossible she cou'd recover; nor have I ever seen her chearful since her husband died. But from the moment she perceived your particular attachment, her melancholy was encreased, and she has seemed twenty times upon the point of expressing her uneasiness at your constant assiduities. For these last three days she appeared to be quite retired within herself, and I have had so many disagreeable things to engross my    thoughts, that I was rather pleased at her reserve, and did not attempt to draw her out of it. 
GrifMSL.txt	51	240.0	1776	Griffith, Mrs. (Elizabeth), 1720?-1793	THE STORY OF LADY JULIANA HARLEY.	  I have met with a tender sympathizing friend and confidante here. I shall be angry if you smile, Stanley, when I tell you it is Nancy Weston I never saw joy so strongly painted in any countenance as hers, when she met me; our surprize was mutual, but luckily this unexpected interview happened about eight o'clock in the morning, and we had no spectators to restrain, or comment upon the strong expressions of a grateful heart.  She told me before I went to Delville, that she was very capable of the millinery business, having formerly lived some time with a relation of hers, who had kept a shop in Tavistock-Street, but who was now dead. I then told her that if she cou'd find out any method of establishing herself properly in business, I wou'd assist her with the    means of carrying it on, and left her a few guineas to clothe and support her, till my return.  During the few hours I spent in London before I came here, my mind was so violently agitated, that I never once thought of Nancy Weston, and the poor girl's modesty wou'd have prevented her from ever applying to me, or being farther burthensome, as she expresses it, had not chance thrown her in my way at this time. She works with a very creditable chamber milliner, who had known her formerly at her cousin's, and who will take her into partnership with a few hundreds, which she shall have with an hearty welcome into the bargain, for I think I need not tell you, that her happiness will contribute to mine.

I hope you are successful at Bath, though there is danger there of meeting with your match; and give me leave to say, you are not qualified for such an encounter: you lose your    temper with your money, and know not how to retire with the easy gentleman-like sans froid of yours.  G. SEWELL.        LETTER XXVII.  LADY JULIANA HARLEY, TO MISS EVELYN.  Yes, my Lucy! I will hasten to your relief, or rather to my own Miss Harley's ill temper has rendered this place so hateful to me, that I can no longer abide in't.  Surely there is a fatality that attends the meeting of an Evelyn and an Harley. From the moment that your brother left this house, she has    treated me with the utmost asperity. She says she is certain that the whole race of Evelyns are idiots, or that I must have given them philtres. But it is they, not me, who have the art of fascination, for this poor lady is become enamoured by a single glance of your brother. Perhaps the sudden fright she received from the strong resemblance between him and the lamented Henry, has occasioned this extraordinary prepossession; though love is by no means the offspring of fear. But no matter for the cause, the effects have been dreadful to me, and I am resolved to withdraw myself from them as quickly as possible.

I perfectly agree with you that the Ladies Juliana and Desmond are a couple of hypocrites, but I think Mrs. Stanley worse than either of them; tho' hypocrisy, indeed, is not one of her failings She has written me a card, in answer to an invitation of mine, civilly forbidding me her house! while Lady    Desmond, who has I own some cause to hate me, receives me with such an icy kind of politeness, as would freeze, or rather petrify me, if the warmth of Sir James's reception did not make ample amends for the bleakness of her ladyship's air and manner.  I am grown extravagantly fond of play Unluckily, Dupont dislikes it In truth, he knows nothing of the matter; but his politeness makes him easily prevailed upon to fill up a corner at a whisttable, while I enjoy the delights of loo, or pharo, without controul.  You don't know how much you are obliged to me for devoting so much of my time to you at present; for as I am the only female of my party, I am sure they wait for me, and so does my carriage to whisk me to them.    Adieu, my dear Harley; remember to enquire for some place to stuff my mother into, and believe me  Your's,  M. DUPONT.

If Lady Juliana had not marred her own fortune, by refusing Lord Somners, I should have done it for her, by dropping a few suspicious hints to his Lordship, who is an intimate acquaintance of Dupont's, and frequently visits here. There is no pleasure like demolishing a prude but half my satisfaction is destroyed, by knowing that she don't like the man yet it may mortify her pride a little to know that he thinks ill of her It shall be done.          LETTER XLV.  MR. STANLEY TO MR. EVELYN.  I TAKE up the pen to address you in the same manner that Queen Anne's ministers used to Lord Peterborough, and write rather at than to you.  I hope you are by this time set out on your tour, and think it highly probable that this may find you measuring some of those stupendous lusus naturae, vulgarly called the Giant's Causeway as if dame Nature, who is an admirable oeconomist, ever used two means to produce one end, and first made giants    merely to lift these massy piles of quarry, which most assuredly grew in the very spot where you will find them. We have some such superstition, I think, with regard to Stonehenge also; but, like all other traditions, it is only believed by the ignorant; though, by the way, the learned have not yet been able to tell us how those huge pillars were conveyed to Salisbury plain; and I can hardly suppose them to have started up there of their own accord; though there are a sort of philosophers who liberally endow stupid and sluggish matter with both thought and action.

Our Emma too, you tell me, is more chearful pleasing intelligence! never may gloom again oppress her gentle spirits, or sadness cloud the sweet serenity    of her complacent brow! I wish you to amuse her, Lucy: carry her from home sad recipe! to seek for happiness by flying from the only spot where it is most naturally to be found! and yet in hers, as in many other cases, disappointment blasts it in its native soil, while dissipation steals its fading colours, and wears a faint resemblance of it to the world. For this, I fear, our Emma must compound.  Captain and Miss Harrison returned hither with me. In a few days I hope I shall prevail on Mrs. Williams to make a very deserving man happy, by bestowing her hand and heart upon the Captain. Soon after their marriage they purpose going to the South of France, for the entire recovery of Mrs. Williams's health, which is far from valid, though she is better than I ever hoped to see her. Miss Harrison, and a young man    a very good family and fortune, who is her sincere admirer, will accompany them. She has not yet recovered the vivacity she possessed before her attachment to Captain Williams; but time, they say, can conquer every thing, and will, I trust, erase the memory of that disagreeable event from her mind.  I know not why, but my spirits are uncommonly low at present, there is no nostrum for a mind diseased, and therefore your kind wish for your suffering friends is vain.

May you long enjoy those charming spirits, that contribute so much to your own and your friend's happiness. My sincere regards attend Sir William Stanley, Lady Desmond, and the Selwyns. Accept the same from your affectionate brother,  C. EVELYN.        LETTER LXII.  LADY O'SHAUGHNASY TO MADAME DUPONT  Mallow.  RUINED and undone, Maria! deceived, stript, and deserted! Can you believe there was ever such a monster in nature as this beggarly baronet, that has imposed on me? I shall keep my title, for a knight he surely is, of some foreign order or other; but the being stiled your Ladyship is all I have got for twenty thousand pounds; luckily for me there is a reversionary heir to the    other ten, and I could not bestow it on my vile husband.  I will be calm if I can, and acquaint you with the whole process of his villainy. He brought me to this place under pretence that his castle (one in the air) was in this county, and that he could have frequent opportunities of seeing how the workmen went on with the repairs, by making short excursions from hence.

O, Maria, what vile hypocrites are these men! would to heaven I had remained single! and yet it was impossible to doubt the apparent fondness of this cruel wretch, who seemed perfectly to doat on me; and I am such a fool, I cannot help lamenting the loss of his tenderness. It must have been that cursed Catty that seduced him from me. How will my prudish sister-in-law, and all the other puritans of my acquaintance, laugh at my being taken in at this time of my life? I cannot bear the thought. I think I had better retire into some place where I am not known, than expose myself to the ridicule of those, who pretend to stile themselves my friends.    No, I will pursue my husband; perhaps I may yet recover his affections or my effects, and get him to discard his infamous accomplice. If you had seen how handsome he looked the very day he left me, you could not have believed him a deceiver.  I know not what to do, my spirits are quite broken. I will hasten to you, as I am certain you will pity your sincere friend,  A. O'SHAUGHNASY.        LETTER LXIII.  LADY JULIANA TO LADY STANLEY. 
GrifMSL.txt	229	20160.0	1776	Griffith, Mrs. (Elizabeth), 1720?-1793	THE STORY OF LADY JULIANA HARLEY.	DEAR Jack, the route is come, and I think it high time to march; Mensieur Dupont will be in town in a few days. I have reason to apprehend that there are others who mean to decamp as well as I; but I may, perhaps, put a spoke in the wheel of the ammunition-cart. I never was so near being nicked in my life, but as luck would have it, I discovered the trick before they counted game.    In return for the intended deceit, I have laid a train that shall blow them all up, though I will not wait the springing of the mine.  This is all heathen Greek to you, but I shall see you in a few days, and at meeting the riddle shall be explained, by  Your's,  G. SEWELL.    P. S. Provide me handsome lodgings, for I mean to make a figure.          LETTER LXVI.  SIR WILLIAM STANLEY TO MR. EVELYN.  DEAR Charles, matters are now come to such a crisis in the Desmond family, that I think your presence, and yours only, can adjust them.  I will, however, relate the particulars of their present situation, and leave you to determine, with regard to your coming, as you think proper.    The card parties at Sir James Desmond's have been, for some time past, to all appearance, broken up; our dear Emma regained her ease and chearfulness, and her husband seemed to behave with more affection and attention towards her, than he had done since her arrival in London. 
GrifMSL.txt	257	10080.0	1776	Griffith, Mrs. (Elizabeth), 1720?-1793	THE STORY OF LADY JULIANA HARLEY.	  Your letter was the harbinger of peace; I could no longer doubt of heaven's forgiveness, when a frail mortal, like myself, looked with compassion on my sufferings, and thought they had atoned for all my faults. Hope, once again, illumined my sad mind, and stilled the beating of my anxious heart. I dared to make my vows From that blessed hour no pang has harrowed up my soul, no bursts of grief have since deformed my face Though the soft drops of penitence sincere will never cease to flow.  Yes, Lucy, I believe that I could bear to see you now, and meet your looks with firmness; yet, for your sake, I would postpone the interview, 'till use has made the idea of our separation more easy to your friendly heart. Yet let me not turn boaster, perhaps your presence    might recal ideas that should be ever banished from my mind; then do not risk my present tranquility, but strive to wean yourself from the affection which you long have borne me, and think of me as a departed friend.  To complete my earthly happiness, I have received a letter from my brother, filled with the tenderest acknowledgments of what he calls the unlucky error, that had led him to behave unkindly to me, and the most earnest entreaties to return and pass my days with him without controul. Blest be the power of truth that has relieved his mind from the indignant, yet humiliating sensation, that must arise from the dishonour of a sister.

For my own part I never felt resentment to my foes, and only grieved for    what my brother suffered. I am indebted to their malice, Lucy. They meant to sting my heart, but have procured its peace. May penitence for the intended mischief assuage their own remorse.  I am infinitely indebted to the amiable superior of our convent for many indulgencies She knew and loved my mother, and has transferred that kindness to your friend. From this cause, were there no other, I should be pleased with her society; but she is sensible, as well as good.  I mention this little circumstance to render you more easy at my seclusion from a world which has to me most surely been a world of woe. May every happiness it can afford await my tender friend and may we meet again in that    blessed place, where every tear is wiped from every eye, to part no more.  ST. MARY MAGDALEN.

FlemISL.txt	0	61920.0	1962	Fleming, Ian	The spy who loved me	PART ONE        ME            1 ....... SCAREDY CAT      I WAS running away. I was running away from England, from my childhood, from the winter, from a sequence of untidy, unattractive love-affairs, from the few sticks of furniture and jumble of overworn clothes that my London life had collected around me; and I was running away from drabness, fustiness, snobbery, the claustrophobia of close horizons and from my inability, although I am quite an attractive rat, to make headway in the rat-race. In fact, I was running away from almost everything except the law.    And I had run a very long way indeed – almost, exaggerating a bit, halfway round the world. In fact, I had come all the way from London to The Dreamy Pines Motor Court which is ten miles west of Lake George, the famous American tourist resort in the Adirondacks – that vast expanse of mountains, lakes and pine forests which forms most of the northern territory of New York State. I had started on September the first, and it was now Friday the thirteenth of October. When I had left, the grimy little row of domesticated maples in my square had been green, or as green as any tree can be in London in August. Now, in the billion-strong army of pine trees that marched away northwards towards the Canadian border, the real, wild maples flamed here and there like shrapnel-bursts.
FlemISL.txt	1	61920.0	1962	Fleming, Ian	The spy who loved me	And I felt that I, or at any rate my skin, had changed just as much – from the grimy sallowness that had been the badge of my London life to the snap and colour and sparkle of living out of doors and going to bed early and all those other dear dull things that had been part of my life in Quebec before it was decided that I must go to England and learn to be a ‘lady’. Very unfashionable, of course, this cherry-ripe, strength-through-joy complexion, and I had even stopped using lipstick and nail varnish, but to me it had been like sloughing off a borrowed skin and getting back into my own, and I was childishly happy and pleased with myself whenever I looked in the mirror (that’s another thing – I’ll never say ‘looking-glass’ again; I just don’t have to any more) and found myself not wanting to paint a different face over my own. I’m not being smug about this. I was just running away from the person I’d been for the past five years. I wasn’t particularly pleased with the person I was now, but I had hated and despised the other one, and I was glad to be rid of her face. 
FlemISL.txt	18	5256000.0	1962	Fleming, Ian	The spy who loved me	The sisters were strict and the accent was very much on piety, with the result that I learned a great deal of religious history and rather obscure dogma which I would gladly have exchanged for subjects that would have fitted me to be something other than a nurse or a nun and, when in the end the atmosphere became so stifling to my spirit that I begged to be taken away, my aunt gladly rescued me from ‘The Papists’ and it was decided that, at the age of sixteen, I should go to England and be ‘finished’. This caused something of a local hullabaloo. Not only are the Ursulines the centre of Catholic tradition in Quebec – the Convent proudly owns the skull of Montcalm: for two centuries there have never been less than nine sisters kneeling at prayer, night and day, before the chapel altar – but my family had belonged to the very innermost citadel of French-Canadianism and that their daughter should flout both treasured folkways at one blow was a nine days’ wonder–and scandal. 
FlemISL.txt	33	141120.0	1962	Fleming, Ian	The spy who loved me	  In my memory of those days the sun is always shining and the willows dip into water as limpid clear as the sky. Swans ride in the shadows of the poplars and swallows dip and skim as the Thames slips down from Queens Eyot, past Boveney Lock and Coocoo Weir, where we used to bathe, and on down the long stretch through Brocas meadows towards Windsor Bridge. It surely must have rained, there must have been noisy holiday-makers crowding our river, there must have been clouds in our private skies, but if there were I can’t remember them. The weeks slipped by like the river, sparkling, luminous, full of enchantment.    And then came the last Saturday of September and, though till then we had ignored the fact, a new chapter had to be opened. Susan was coming back to the flat on Monday, I had the chance of a job, and Derek was going up to Oxford. We pretended it would all be the same. I would explain to Susan and there would be weekends when I could go to Oxford or Derek come up to London. We didn’t discuss our affair. It was obvious that it would go on. Derek had talked vaguely of my meeting his parents, but he had never pressed it and on our Saturdays together there were always so many better things to do. Perhaps I thought it rather odd that Derek seemed to have no time for me during the week, but he played a lot of cricket and tennis and had hosts of friends all of whom he said were a bore. I didn’t want to get mixed up in this side of his life, at any rate not for the present. I was happy to have him absolutely to myself for our one day a week. I didn’t want to share him with a crowd of other people who would anyway make me shy. So things were left very much in the air, and I just didn’t look beyond the next Saturday. 
FlemISL.txt	47	2.0	1962	Fleming, Ian	The spy who loved me	  The letter began, ‘Dear Viv, This is going to be a difficult letter to write.’ When I had got that far I went into my bedroom and locked the door and sat on my bed and gathered my courage. The letter went on to say that it had been a wonderful summer and he would never forget me. But now his life had changed and he would have a lot of work to do and there wouldn’t be much room for ‘girls’. He had told his parents about me, but they disapproved of our ‘affair’. They said it wasn’t fair to go on with a girl if one wasn’t going to marry her. ‘They are terribly insular, I’m afraid, and they have ridiculous ideas about “foreigners”, although heaven knows I regard you as just like any other English girl and you know I adore your accent.’ They were set on his marrying the daughter of some neighbour in the country. ‘I’ve never told you about this, which I’m afraid was very naughty of me, but as a matter of fact we’re sort of semi-engaged. We had such a marvellous time together and you were such a sport that I didn’t want to spoil it all.’ He said he hoped very much we would ‘run into each other’ again one day and in the meantime he had asked Fortnum’s to send me a dozen bottles of pink champagne, ‘the best’, to remind me of the first time we had met.
FlemISL.txt	61	2.0	1962	Fleming, Ian	The spy who loved me	  Kurt’s arms were round me and he was holding me desperately. ‘Now I have only you,’ he said through his sobs. ‘You must be kind. You must give me comfort.’    I smoothed his hair as maternally as I could, wondering how to escape from his embrace, yet at the same time being melted by the despair of this strong man and by his dependence on me. I tried to make my voice sound matter-of-fact. ‘Well, if you ask me, it was a lucky escape. Any girl as changeable as that would not have made you a good wife. There are many other better girls in Germany. Come on, Kurt.’ I struggled to sit up. ‘We’ll go out to dinner and a cinema. It will take your mind off things. It’s no good crying over spilt milk. Come on!’ I freed myself rather breathlessly and we both got to our feet.    Kurt hung his head. ‘Ah, but you are good to me, Viv. You are a real friend in need – eine echte Kameradin. And you are right. I must not behave like a weakling. You will be ashamed of me. And that I could not bear.’ He gave me a tortured smile and went to the door and let himself out. 
FlemISL.txt	62	20160.0	1962	Fleming, Ian	The spy who loved me	  Only two weeks later we were lovers. It was somehow inevitable. I had half known it would be, and I did nothing to dodge my fate. I was not in love with him, and yet we had grown so close in so many other ways that the next step of sleeping together was bound, inexorably, to follow. The details were really quite dull. The occasional friendly kiss on the cheek, as if to a sister, came by degrees closer to my mouth and one day was on it. There was a pause in the campaign while I came to take this kind of kiss for granted, then came the soft assault on my breasts and then on my body, all so pleasurable, so calm, so lacking in drama, and then, one evening in my sitting-room, the slow stripping of my body ‘because I must see how beautiful you are’, the feeble, almost languorous protests, and then the scientific operation that had been prepared for Trude. And how delicious it was, in the wonderful privacy of my own room! How safe, how unhurried, how reassuring the precautions! And how strong and gentle Kurt was, and of all things to associate with love-making, how divinely polite! A single flower after each time, the room tidied after each passionate ecstasy, studious correctness in the office and before other people, never a rough or even a dirty word – it was like a series of exquisite operations by a surgeon with the best bedside manners in the world. Of course, it was all rather impersonal. But I liked that. It was sex without involvement or danger, a delicious heightening of the day’s routine which each time left me sleek and glowing like a pampered cat. 
FlemISL.txt	78	1440.0	1962	Fleming, Ian	The spy who loved me	Of course I had to put up with a good deal of wolf-whistling from the young, and grinning and hand-waving from the old, but I’m afraid I rather enjoyed being something of the sensation my aunt had predicted and I smiled with varying sweetness at all and sundry. The shoulders of most North American roads are bad and I had been afraid that people would crowd my tiny machine and that I would be in constant trouble with potholes, but I suppose I looked such a fragile little outfit that other drivers gave me a wide berth and I usually had the whole of the inside lane of the highway to myself.    Things went so well that first day that I managed to get through Montreal before nightfall and twenty miles on down Route 9 that would take me over the border into New York State the next morning. I put up at a place called The Southern Trail Motel, where I was treated as if I was Amelia Earhart or Amy Mollison – a rather pleasurable routine that I became accustomed to – and, after a square meal in the cafeteria and the shy acceptance of one drink with the proprietor, I retired to bed feeling excited and happy. It had been a long and wonderful day. The Vespa was a dream, and my whole plan was working out fine. 
FlemISL.txt	82	20.0	1962	Fleming, Ian	The spy who loved me	  But Mr Phancey wouldn’t leave me alone. While I ate, he came and sat at my little table and told me some of his dull life-story and, in between episodes, slipped in questions about me and my plans – what parents I had, didn’t I mind being so far from home, did I have any friends in the States, and so on – innocuous questions, put, it seemed to me, with normal curiosity. He was after all around forty-five, old enough to be my father, and though he was obviously a dirty old man, they were a common enough breed, and anyway Mrs Phancey was keeping an eye on us from the desk at the other end of the room.    Mr Phancey finally left me and went over to his wife and, while I smoked a cigarette and finished my second cup of coffee (‘No charge, miss. Compliments of The Dreamy Pines’), I heard them talking in a low voice over something that, because of an occasional chuckle, seemed to give them satisfaction. Finally Mrs Phancey came over, clucking in a motherly fashion about my adventurous plans (‘My, oh, my! What will you modern girls be doing next?’), and then she sat down and, looking as winsome as she knew how, said why didn’t I stop over for a few days and have a rest and earn myself a handful of dollars into the bargain? It seemed their receptionist had walked out twenty-four hours before and, what with the housekeeping and tidying-up before they closed the place for the season, they would have no time to man the desk. Would I care to take on the job of receptionist for the final two weeks – full board and thirty dollars a week? 
FlemISL.txt	95	2.0	1962	Fleming, Ian	The spy who loved me	Then a deafening silence in which the last empty shell tinkled away on the floor. Sluggsy turned back to me. His hands were empty. The gun had gone. His eyes were dreamy with pleasure at his marksmanship. He said softly, ‘How’s them for credentials, baby?’    The small cloud of blue smoke had reached me, and I smelled the cordite. My legs were trembling. I said, scornfully I hope, ‘That’s a lot of wasted coffee. Now, what about your names?’    The thin man said, ‘The lady’s right. You didn’t ought to of spilled that Java, Sluggsy. But ya see, lady, that’s why they call him Sluggsy, on account he’s smart with the hardware. Sluggsy Morant. Me, I’m Sol Horowitz. They call me “Horror”. Can’t say why. Kin you, Sluggsy?’    Sluggsy giggled. ‘Mebbe one time you gave some guy a scare, Horror. Mebbe a whole bunch of guys. Leastwise that’s what they tell me.’    Horror made no comment. He said quietly, ‘Okay. Let’s go! Sluggsy, see to the cabins like I said. Lady, you make us some chow. Keep ya nose clean and co-operate and ya won’t get hurt. Okay?’    Sluggsy looked me over greedily. He said, ‘Not much, that is. Eh, bimbo?’ and walked over to the key rack behind the desk and took down all the keys and let himself out through the back entrance. I put down the chair, and, as coolly as I knew how, but painfully aware of my toreador pants, walked across the room and went behind the counter. 
FlemISL.txt	101	1.0	1962	Fleming, Ian	The spy who loved me	  The big radio and TV was on a pedestal near the back door. It had been playing softly all this time, although I had been quite unconscious of it. I went to the machine and fiddled with the dials, putting the volume up. The two men were talking to each other quietly and there was the clatter of cutlery. Now or never! I measured my distance to the door handle and dived to the left.            9 ....... THEN I BEGAN TO SCREAM      I HEARD a single bullet crash into the metal frame of the door, and then, with my hand cushioning the ice-pick so it didn’t stick into me, I was running hell for leather across the wet grass. Mercifully the rain had let up, but the grass was soaking and slippery under my hopeless flat soles and I knew I wasn’t making enough speed. I heard a door crash open behind me and Sluggsy’s voice shouted, ‘Hold it, or you’re cold turkey!’ I began to weave, but then the shots came, carefully, evenly spaced, and bees whipped past me and slapped into the grass. Another ten yards and I would be at the corner of the cabins and out of the light. I dodged and zigzagged, my skin quivering as it waited for the bullet. A window in the last cabin tinkled with broken glass and I was round the corner. As I dived into the soaking wood I heard a car start up. What was that for? 
FlemISL.txt	111	10.0	1962	Fleming, Ian	The spy who loved me	Each mouthful – the forkful of egg, the bit of bacon, the munch of buttery toast – was an exquisite thing that occupied all my senses. Now I knew what it must be like to get some food smuggled into jail, to be a prisoner of war and get a parcel from home, to find water in the desert, to be given a hot drink after being rescued from drowning. The simple act of living, how precious it was! If I got out of this, I would know it for ever. I would be grateful for every breath I breathed, every meal I ate, every night I felt the cool kiss of sheets, the peace of a bed behind a closed, a locked, door. Why had I never known this before? Why had my parents, my lost religion, never taught it to me? Anyway, I knew now. I had found it out for myself. Love of life is born of the awareness of death, of the dread of it. Nothing makes one really grateful for life except the black wings of danger.    These feverish thoughts were born of the intoxication of the food and of eating it alone behind the barricade of the counter. For a few moments I was back in the old life. So, light-headedly, and to hug the moment to me, I lit the cigarette. 
FlemISL.txt	112	1.0	1962	Fleming, Ian	The spy who loved me	  Perhaps a minute later, the mumble of the voices died. Behind ‘Tales of the Vienna Woods’ coming softly from the radio, I heard a chair being drawn back. Now I felt panic. I put out the cigarette in the dregs of my coffee and got up and began briskly turning taps and clattering the dishes in the metal sink. I didn’t look, but I could see Sluggsy coming across the room. He came up to the counter and leaned on it. I looked up as if surprised. He was still chewing away at a toothpick, flicking it from side to side of his thick-lipped, oval mouth. He had a box of Kleenex that he put on the counter. He wrenched out a handful of tissues and blew his nose and dropped the tissues on the floor. He said in an amiable voice, ‘Ya gone an’ given me a catarrh, bimbo. All that chasing aroun’ in the woods. This trouble of mine, this alopecia thing that kills the hair. You know what that does? That kills the hairs inside the nose too. Together with all the rest. An’ you know what that does? That makes your schnozzle dribble bad when you got a cold. You given me a cold, bimbo. That means a box of wipes every twenty-four hours. More, mebbe. Ya ever think of that? Ya ever think of people have no hairs in their snouts? Aargh!’ The hairless eyes were suddenly hard with anger. ‘You gashes are all the same.
FlemISL.txt	114	0.4998	1962	Fleming, Ian	The spy who loved me	  ‘I’m sorry. I’m tired.’    Sluggsy came back to the counter. He said angrily, ‘You’ve got a big keister giving me that crap. Cheap little hustler! I’ll give you something to make you tired.’    Suddenly there was an obscene little black leather cosh in his hand. He brought it down with a dull whack on the counter. It left a deep dent in the formica. He began to move stealthily round the edge of the counter, humming to himself, his eyes holding mine. I backed up into the far corner. This was going to be my last gesture. Somehow I must hurt him back before I went under. My hand felt for the open cutlery drawer and suddenly I dipped in and flung, all in one motion. His duck wasn’t quick enough, and the silver spray of knives and forks burst round his head. He put a hand up to his face and backed away, cursing. I hurled some more and then some more, but they only clattered inoffensively round his hunched head. Now the thin man was moving fast across the room. I grabbed the carving knife and made a dash for Sluggsy, but he saw me coming and dodged behind a table. Unhurriedly, Horror took off his coat and wrapped it round his left arm, then they both picked up chairs and, holding the legs out like bulls’ horns, they charged me from both sides. I made one ineffectual slash at an arm, and then the knife was knocked out of my hand and all I could do was to get back behind the counter.

On the way over the lawn he said, ‘Mind out for the potholes between here and Glens Falls, miss. Some of them are so deep you better sound your horn before you get to them. There might be other folks with little machines like this at the bottom of them.’ I laughed. He was clean and gay and young, but tough and adventurous as well by the looks of him and from his job. Perhaps this was more the type of man I should build dreams about!    I said goodbye to Captain Stonor and thanked him. Then, rather frightened of making a fool of myself, I put on my crash helmet and pulled down my saucy, fur-lined goggles, got on the machine and stamped on the starter pedal. Thank heavens the little engine fired right away! Now I would show them! By design, the rear wheel was still on its stand, I let in the clutch fairly fast and gave a quick push. The spinning rear wheel made contact with the loose surface of the road, and dust and pebbles flew. And I was gone like a rocket and, in ten seconds through the gears, I was doing forty. The surface looked all right ahead so I took a chance and glanced back and raised a cheeky hand in farewell, and there was a wave from the little group of police in front of the smoking lobby block. And then I was off down the long straight road between the two sentinel rows of pine trees and I thought the trees looked sorry to be letting me get away unharmed.

The scars of my terror had been healed, wiped away, by this stranger who slept with a gun under his pillow, this secret agent who was only known by a number.    A secret agent? I didn’t care what he did. A number? I had already forgotten it. I knew exactly who he was and what he was. And everything, every smallest detail, would be written on my heart for ever.
StowHUT.txt	0	20.0	1852	Stowe, Harriet Beecher	Uncle Tom's Cabin	UNCLE TOM'S CABIN  VOLUME I      CHAPTER I    In Which the Reader Is Introduced to a Man of Humanity      Late in the afternoon of a chilly day in February, two gentlemen were  sitting alone over their wine, in a well-furnished dining parlor, in  the town of P----, in Kentucky. There were no servants present, and the  gentlemen, with chairs closely approaching, seemed to be discussing some  subject with great earnestness.    For convenience sake, we have said, hitherto, two _gentlemen_. One of  the parties, however, when critically examined, did not seem, strictly  speaking, to come under the species. He was a short, thick-set man,  with coarse, commonplace features, and that swaggering air of pretension  which marks a low man who is trying to elbow his way upward in the  world. He was much over-dressed, in a gaudy vest of many colors, a blue  neckerchief, bedropped gayly with yellow spots, and arranged with a  flaunting tie, quite in keeping with the general air of the man. His  hands, large and coarse, were plentifully bedecked with rings; and he  wore a heavy gold watch-chain, with a bundle of seals of portentous  size, and a great variety of colors, attached to it,--which, in the  ardor of conversation, he was in the habit of flourishing and jingling  with evident satisfaction. His conversation was in free and easy  defiance of Murray's Grammar,* and was garnished at convenient intervals  with various profane expressions, which not even the desire to be  graphic in our account shall induce us to transcribe. 
StowHUT.txt	1	1.0	1852	Stowe, Harriet Beecher	Uncle Tom's Cabin	  * English Grammar (1795), by Lindley Murray (1745-1826), the  most authoritative American grammarian of his day.    His companion, Mr. Shelby, had the appearance of a gentleman; and the  arrangements of the house, and the general air of the housekeeping,  indicated easy, and even opulent circumstances. As we before stated, the  two were in the midst of an earnest conversation.    "That is the way I should arrange the matter," said Mr. Shelby.    "I can't make trade that way--I positively can't, Mr. Shelby," said the  other, holding up a glass of wine between his eye and the light.    "Why, the fact is, Haley, Tom is an uncommon fellow; he is certainly  worth that sum anywhere,--steady, honest, capable, manages my whole farm  like a clock."    "You mean honest, as niggers go," said Haley, helping himself to a glass  of brandy.    "No; I mean, really, Tom is a good, steady, sensible, pious fellow. He  got religion at a camp-meeting, four years ago; and I believe he  really _did_ get it. I've trusted him, since then, with everything I  have,--money, house, horses,--and let him come and go round the country;  and I always found him true and square in everything." 
StowHUT.txt	8	2.0	1852	Stowe, Harriet Beecher	Uncle Tom's Cabin	  "Lor bless ye, yes! These critters ain't like white folks, you know;  they gets over things, only manage right. Now, they say," said Haley,  assuming a candid and confidential air, "that this kind o' trade is  hardening to the feelings; but I never found it so. Fact is, I never  could do things up the way some fellers manage the business. I've seen  'em as would pull a woman's child out of her arms, and set him up  to sell, and she screechin' like mad all the time;--very bad  policy--damages the article--makes 'em quite unfit for service  sometimes. I knew a real handsome gal once, in Orleans, as was entirely  ruined by this sort o' handling. The fellow that was trading for her  didn't want her baby; and she was one of your real high sort, when her  blood was up. I tell you, she squeezed up her child in her arms, and  talked, and went on real awful. It kinder makes my blood run cold to  think of 't; and when they carried off the child, and locked her up,  she jest went ravin' mad, and died in a week. Clear waste, sir, of a  thousand dollars, just for want of management,--there's where 't  is. It's always best to do the humane thing, sir; that's been _my_  experience." And the trader leaned back in his chair, and folded his  arm, with an air of virtuous decision, apparently considering himself a  second Wilberforce. 
StowHUT.txt	68	2.5	1852	Stowe, Harriet Beecher	Uncle Tom's Cabin	  "Mr. Haley," said Mr. Shelby, "if I did not think you had some cause  for disappointment, I should not have borne from you the rude and  unceremonious style of your entrance into my parlor this morning. I say  thus much, however, since appearances call for it, that I shall allow  of no insinuations cast upon me, as if I were at all partner to any  unfairness in this matter. Moreover, I shall feel bound to give you  every assistance, in the use of horses, servants, &c., in the recovery  of your property. So, in short, Haley," said he, suddenly dropping from  the tone of dignified coolness to his ordinary one of easy frankness,  "the best way for you is to keep good-natured and eat some breakfast,  and we will then see what is to be done."    Mrs. Shelby now rose, and said her engagements would prevent her being  at the breakfast-table that morning; and, deputing a very respectable  mulatto woman to attend to the gentlemen's coffee at the side-board, she  left the room.    "Old lady don't like your humble servant, over and above," said Haley,  with an uneasy effort to be very familiar.    "I am not accustomed to hear my wife spoken of with such freedom," said  Mr. Shelby, dryly.    "Beg pardon; of course, only a joke, you know," said Haley, forcing a  laugh.    "Some jokes are less agreeable than others," rejoined Shelby.    "Devilish free, now I've signed those papers, cuss him!" muttered Haley  to himself; "quite grand, since yesterday!" 
StowHUT.txt	119	2.0	1852	Stowe, Harriet Beecher	Uncle Tom's Cabin	  "Easy! couldn't nobody a done it, without de Lord. Why, now," said Sam,  "'t was jist dis yer way. Mas'r Haley, and me, and Andy, we comes up  to de little tavern by the river, and I rides a leetle ahead,--(I's so  zealous to be a cotchin' Lizy, that I couldn't hold in, no way),--and  when I comes by the tavern winder, sure enough there she was, right in  plain sight, and dey diggin' on behind. Wal, I loses off my hat, and  sings out nuff to raise the dead. Course Lizy she hars, and she dodges  back, when Mas'r Haley he goes past the door; and then, I tell ye, she  clared out de side door; she went down de river bank;--Mas'r Haley he  seed her, and yelled out, and him, and me, and Andy, we took arter. Down  she come to the river, and thar was the current running ten feet wide  by the shore, and over t' other side ice a sawin' and a jiggling up and  down, kinder as 't were a great island. We come right behind her, and I  thought my soul he'd got her sure enough,--when she gin sich a screech  as I never hearn, and thar she was, clar over t' other side of  the current, on the ice, and then on she went, a screeching and a  jumpin',--the ice went crack! c'wallop! cracking! chunk! and she a  boundin' like a buck!

StowHUT.txt	139	5.0	1852	Stowe, Harriet Beecher	Uncle Tom's Cabin	  The two little boys, after a desperate rummaging in their pockets, in  search of those pocket-handkerchiefs which mothers know are never to  be found there, had thrown themselves disconsolately into the skirts of  their mother's gown, where they were sobbing, and wiping their eyes and  noses, to their hearts' content;--Mrs. Bird had her face fairly hidden  in her pocket-handkerchief; and old Dinah, with tears streaming down her  black, honest face, was ejaculating, "Lord have mercy on us!" with all  the fervor of a camp-meeting;--while old Cudjoe, rubbing his eyes very  hard with his cuffs, and making a most uncommon variety of wry faces,  occasionally responded in the same key, with great fervor. Our senator  was a statesman, and of course could not be expected to cry, like other  mortals; and so he turned his back to the company, and looked out of the  window, and seemed particularly busy in clearing his throat and wiping  his spectacle-glasses, occasionally blowing his nose in a manner that  was calculated to excite suspicion, had any one been in a state to  observe critically.    "How came you to tell me you had a kind master?" he suddenly exclaimed,  gulping down very resolutely some kind of rising in his throat, and  turning suddenly round upon the woman. 
StowHUT.txt	252	2.0	1852	Stowe, Harriet Beecher	Uncle Tom's Cabin	  Tom looked up. It was not in nature to look into that gay, young,  handsome face, without a feeling of pleasure; and Tom felt the tears  start in his eyes as he said, heartily, "God bless you, Mas'r!"    "Well, I hope he will. What's your name? Tom? Quite as likely to do it  for your asking as mine, from all accounts. Can you drive horses, Tom?"    "I've been allays used to horses," said Tom. "Mas'r Shelby raised heaps  of 'em."    "Well, I think I shall put you in coachy, on condition that you won't be  drunk more than once a week, unless in cases of emergency, Tom."    Tom looked surprised, and rather hurt, and said, "I never drink, Mas'r."    "I've heard that story before, Tom; but then we'll see. It will be a  special accommodation to all concerned, if you don't. Never mind, my  boy," he added, good-humoredly, seeing Tom still looked grave; "I don't  doubt you mean to do well."    "I sartin do, Mas'r," said Tom.    "And you shall have good times," said Eva. "Papa is very good to  everybody, only he always will laugh at them."    "Papa is much obliged to you for his recommendation," said St. Clare,  laughing, as he turned on his heel and walked away.        CHAPTER XV    Of Tom's New Master, and Various Other Matters      Since the thread of our humble hero's life has now become interwoven  with that of higher ones, it is necessary to give some brief  introduction to them. 
StowHUT.txt	285	15.0	1852	Stowe, Harriet Beecher	Uncle Tom's Cabin	  "Now, that's just like St. Clare!" said the latter, withdrawing her  handkerchief with somewhat of a spirited flourish when the criminal to  be affected by it was no longer in sight. "He never realizes, never  can, never will, what I suffer, and have, for years. If I was one of the  complaining sort, or ever made any fuss about my ailments, there would  be some reason for it. Men do get tired, naturally, of a complaining  wife. But I've kept things to myself, and borne, and borne, till St.  Clare has got in the way of thinking I can bear anything."    Miss Ophelia did not exactly know what she was expected to answer to  this.    While she was thinking what to say, Marie gradually wiped away her  tears, and smoothed her plumage in a general sort of way, as a dove  might be supposed to make toilet after a shower, and began a housewifely  chat with Miss Ophelia, concerning cupboards, closets, linen-presses,  store-rooms, and other matters, of which the latter was, by common  understanding, to assume the direction,--giving her so many cautious  directions and charges, that a head less systematic and business-like  than Miss Ophelia's would have been utterly dizzied and confounded.    "And now," said Marie, "I believe I've told you everything; so that,  when my next sick turn comes on, you'll be able to go forward entirely,  without consulting me;--only about Eva,--she requires watching."    "She seems to be a good child, very," said Miss Ophelia; "I never saw a  better child." 
StowHUT.txt	355	2.5	1852	Stowe, Harriet Beecher	Uncle Tom's Cabin	  "My dear Vermont, you natives up by the North Pole set an extravagant  value on time! What on earth is the use of time to a fellow who has  twice as much of it as he knows what to do with? As to order and system,  where there is nothing to be done but to lounge on the sofa and read, an  hour sooner or later in breakfast or dinner isn't of much account. Now,  there's Dinah gets you a capital dinner,--soup, ragout, roast fowl,  dessert, ice-creams and all,--and she creates it all out of chaos and  old night down there, in that kitchen. I think it really sublime, the  way she manages. But, Heaven bless us! if we are to go down there, and  view all the smoking and squatting about, and hurryscurryation of the  preparatory process, we should never eat more! My good cousin, absolve  yourself from that! It's more than a Catholic penance, and does no more  good. You'll only lose your own temper, and utterly confound Dinah. Let  her go her own way."    "But, Augustine, you don't know how I found things."    "Don't I? Don't I know that the rolling-pin is under her bed, and the  nutmeg-grater in her pocket with her tobacco,--that there are sixty-five  different sugar-bowls, one in every hole in the house,--that she washes  dishes with a dinner-napkin one day, and with a fragment of an old  petticoat the next? But the upshot is, she gets up glorious dinners,  makes superb coffee; and you must judge her as warriors and statesmen  are judged, _by her success_." 
StowHUT.txt	554	7.0	1852	Stowe, Harriet Beecher	Uncle Tom's Cabin	  "Likely story!" said the other, shortly, as he passed on. He paused a  moment before Dolph; then spitting a discharge of tobacco-juice on his  well-blacked boots, and giving a contemptuous umph, he walked on. Again  he stopped before Susan and Emmeline. He put out his heavy, dirty hand,  and drew the girl towards him; passed it over her neck and bust, felt  her arms, looked at her teeth, and then pushed her back against her  mother, whose patient face showed the suffering she had been going  through at every motion of the hideous stranger.    The girl was frightened, and began to cry.    "Stop that, you minx!" said the salesman; "no whimpering here,--the sale  is going to begin." And accordingly the sale begun.    Adolph was knocked off, at a good sum, to the young gentlemen who had  previously stated his intention of buying him; and the other servants of  the St. Clare lot went to various bidders.    "Now, up with you, boy! d'ye hear?" said the auctioneer to Tom.    Tom stepped upon the block, gave a few anxious looks round; all seemed  mingled in a common, indistinct noise,--the clatter of the salesman  crying off his qualifications in French and English, the quick fire of  French and English bids; and almost in a moment came the final thump  of the hammer, and the clear ring on the last syllable of the word  _"dollars,"_ as the auctioneer announced his price, and Tom was made  over.--He had a master! 
StowHUT.txt	632	1.0	1852	Stowe, Harriet Beecher	Uncle Tom's Cabin	  A cold soft hand fell on Legree's at this moment. He turned,--it was  Cassy's; but the cold soft touch recalled his dream of the night before,  and, flashing through the chambers of his brain, came all the fearful  images of the night-watches, with a portion of the horror that  accompanied them.    "Will you be a fool?" said Cassy, in French. "Let him go! Let me alone  to get him fit to be in the field again. Isn't it just as I told you?"    They say the alligator, the rhinoceros, though enclosed in bullet-proof  mail, have each a spot where they are vulnerable; and fierce, reckless,  unbelieving reprobates, have commonly this point in superstitious dread.    Legree turned away, determined to let the point go for the time.    "Well, have it your own way," he said, doggedly, to Cassy.    "Hark, ye!" he said to Tom; "I won't deal with ye now, because the  business is pressing, and I want all my hands; but I _never_ forget.  I'll score it against ye, and sometime I'll have my pay out o' yer old  black hide,--mind ye!"    Legree turned, and went out.    "There you go," said Cassy, looking darkly after him; "your reckoning's  to come, yet!--My poor fellow, how are you?"    "The Lord God hath sent his angel, and shut the lion's mouth, for this  time," said Tom. 
StowHUT.txt	647	300.0	1852	Stowe, Harriet Beecher	Uncle Tom's Cabin	  When a heavy weight presses the soul to the lowest level at which  endurance is possible, there is an instant and desperate effort of every  physical and moral nerve to throw off the weight; and hence the heaviest  anguish often precedes a return tide of joy and courage. So was it  now with Tom. The atheistic taunts of his cruel master sunk his before  dejected soul to the lowest ebb; and, though the hand of faith still  held to the eternal rock, it was a numb, despairing grasp. Tom sat, like  one stunned, at the fire. Suddenly everything around him seemed to fade,  and a vision rose before him of one crowned with thorns, buffeted and  bleeding. Tom gazed, in awe and wonder, at the majestic patience of the  face; the deep, pathetic eyes thrilled him to his inmost heart; his soul  woke, as, with floods of emotion, he stretched out his hands and fell  upon his knees,--when, gradually, the vision changed: the sharp thorns  became rays of glory; and, in splendor inconceivable, he saw that same  face bending compassionately towards him, and a voice said, "He that  overcometh shall sit down with me on my throne, even as I also overcome,  and am set down with my Father on his throne."    How long Tom lay there, he knew not. When he came to himself, the fire  was gone out, his clothes were wet with the chill and drenching dews;  but the dread soul-crisis was past, and, in the joy that filled him, he  no longer felt hunger, cold, degradation, disappointment, wretchedness.

We must stay in that garret a  good while, for, I tell you, he will raise heaven and earth after us.  He'll muster some of those old overseers on the other plantations, and  have a great hunt; and they'll go over every inch of ground in that  swamp. He makes it his boast that nobody ever got away from him. So let  him hunt at his leisure."    "Cassy, how well you have planned it!" said Emmeline. "Who ever would  have thought of it, but you?"    There was neither pleasure nor exultation in Cassy's eyes,--only a  despairing firmness.    "Come," she said, reaching her hand to Emmeline.    The two fugitives glided noiselessly from the house, and flitted,  through the gathering shadows of evening, along by the quarters. The  crescent moon, set like a silver signet in the western sky, delayed a  little the approach of night. As Cassy expected, when quite near the  verge of the swamps that encircled the plantation, they heard a voice  calling to them to stop. It was not Sambo, however, but Legree, who was  pursuing them with violent execrations. At the sound, the feebler spirit  of Emmeline gave way; and, laying hold of Cassy's arm, she said, "O,  Cassy, I'm going to faint!"

George Shelby, interested, as any  other young man might be, by the romance of the incident, no less than  by feelings of humanity, was at the pains to send to Cassy the bill  of sale of Eliza; whose date and name all corresponded with her own  knowledge of facts, and felt no doubt upon her mind as to the identity  of her child. It remained now only for her to trace out the path of the  fugitives.    Madame de Thoux and she, thus drawn together by the singular coincidence  of their fortunes, proceeded immediately to Canada, and began a tour of  inquiry among the stations, where the numerous fugitives from slavery  are located. At Amherstberg they found the missionary with whom George  and Eliza had taken shelter, on their first arrival in Canada; and  through him were enabled to trace the family to Montreal.    George and Eliza had now been five years free. George had found constant  occupation in the shop of a worthy machinist, where he had been earning  a competent support for his family, which, in the mean time, had been  increased by the addition of another daughter.    Little Harry--a fine bright boy--had been put to a good school, and was  making rapid proficiency in knowledge. 
StowHUT.txt	722	15.0	1852	Stowe, Harriet Beecher	Uncle Tom's Cabin	  About a month after this, one morning, all the servants of the Shelby  estate were convened together in the great hall that ran through the  house, to hear a few words from their young master.    To the surprise of all, he appeared among them with a bundle of papers  in his hand, containing a certificate of freedom to every one on the  place, which he read successively, and presented, amid the sobs and  tears and shouts of all present.    Many, however, pressed around him, earnestly begging him not to send  them away; and, with anxious faces, tendering back their free papers.    "We don't want to be no freer than we are. We's allers had all we  wanted. We don't want to leave de ole place, and Mas'r and Missis, and  de rest!"    "My good friends," said George, as soon as he could get a silence,  "there'll be no need for you to leave me. The place wants as many hands  to work it as it did before. We need the same about the house that we  did before. But, you are now free men and free women. I shall pay you  wages for your work, such as we shall agree on. The advantage is, that  in case of my getting in debt, or dying,--things that might happen,--you  cannot now be taken up and sold. I expect to carry on the estate, and  to teach you what, perhaps, it will take you some time to learn,--how  to use the rights I give you as free men and women. I expect you to be  good, and willing to learn; and I trust in God that I shall be faithful,  and willing to teach. And now, my friends, look up, and thank God for  the blessing of freedom." 
StowHUT.txt	723	15.0	1852	Stowe, Harriet Beecher	Uncle Tom's Cabin	  An aged, partriarchal negro, who had grown gray and blind on the estate,  now rose, and, lifting his trembling hand said, "Let us give thanks unto  the Lord!" As all kneeled by one consent, a more touching and hearty _Te  Deum_ never ascended to heaven, though borne on the peal of organ, bell  and cannon, than came from that honest old heart.    On rising, another struck up a Methodist hymn, of which the burden was,    "The year of Jubilee is come,--  Return, ye ransomed sinners, home."    "One thing more," said George, as he stopped the congratulations of the  throng; "you all remember our good old Uncle Tom?"    George here gave a short narration of the scene of his death, and of his  loving farewell to all on the place, and added,    "It was on his grave, my friends, that I resolved, before God, that I  would never own another slave, while it was possible to free him; that  nobody, through me, should ever run the risk of being parted from home  and friends, and dying on a lonely plantation, as he died. So, when you  rejoice in your freedom, think that you owe it to that good old soul,  and pay it back in kindness to his wife and children. Think of your  freedom, every time you see UNCLE TOM'S CABIN; and let it be a memorial  to put you all in mind to follow in his steps, and be honest and  faithful and Christian as he was."

MY BIRTH: FAMILY DIGNITY INSULTED: RESENTMENT OF MY GRANDFATHER: PARENTAL TRAITS OF CHARACTER.    THERE are moments in which every man is apt to imagine, that the history of his own life is the most important of all histories. The gloom and sunshine, with which my short existence has been chequered, lead me to suppose that a narrative of these vicissitudes may be interesting to others, as well as to myself.  In the opinion of some people, my misfortunes began before I was born. The rector of * * *, my grandfather,    was as vain or his ancestry, as a German baron: and perhaps with no less reason, being convinced that Adam himself was his great progenitor. My mother, not having the fear of her father before her eyes, forgetful of the family dignity, disgraced herself, and contaminated the blood of her offspring, by marrying a farmer's son. Had she married a gentleman, what that very different being, which a gentleman doubtless must have generated, might have been, is more than I, as I now am, can pretend to divine. As it is, however low it may sink me in the reader's opinion, truth obliges me to own, I am but of a mongrel breed.

The delinquency of my mother was aggravated by the daringness of her disobedience; for the rector, having a foresight of what was likely to happen, had laid his express command on her never to see Hugh Trevor, my father, more, on the very night that she eloped. Add to    which, she had the example of an elder sister, to terrify her from such dereliction of duty; who, having married a rake, had been left a widow, poor, desolate, and helpless, and obliged to live an unhappy dependent on her offended father. 'I'll please my eye though I break my heart,' said my mother.  She kept her word. Young Hugh was an athletic, well proportioned, handsome man; of a sanguine temper, prone to pleasure, a frequenter of wakes and fairs, and much addicted to speculate; particularly in cards, cocking, and horse-racing.  Discarded by the rector, who was obstinately irreconcileable, my mother went with her husband to reside in the house of her father-in-law. Folly visits all orders of men. Farmers, as well as lords and rectors, can be proud of their families. The match was considered as an acquisition of dignity to the house of    Trevor; and my mother, bringing such an addition of honour, was most graciously received.

The rats were caught, the box was made, and the ratcatcher commanded to select the finest, fattest and largest of them, and enclose them in their cage. In order to heighten and secure their enjoyment, the Squire and Hector chose four of the stoutest servants, gave the cage into their custody, and ordered the ratcatcher to attend. Away they then went in turbulent procession. They even wanted Olivia to go with them to see the sport; and young Hector, probably with malice prepense against me, when    she refused, was for using force; but she was a favourite with the Squire, and being very determined was suffered to remain at home.  Arrived at the parsonage-house, they entered the hall. The Squire loudly called for the rector. The noise and vociferation of their approach had rouzed his attention, and he was not long in coming. The servants too were collected, some without the door and others of more authority within it, to hear and see what all this could mean. I likewise was one of the company. "Here! here! Mr. Rector," bawled the Squire, "we ha' brought you your due. I'll warrant, for once, you sha'n't grumble that we do not pay you your tythes!"  My grandfather, hearing this address, seeing the covered cage, and remarking the malicious grins of the Squire and his whole posse, knew not what to think, and began to suspect there was mischief in the wind "By the waunds! mister tythe taker," continued the Squire, "but    you shall ha' your own! Here, lads, lift up the cage: put it on the table; let his reverence see what we ha' brought'n! Come, raise the door!"

The captain once more saw my hand in my pocket: I caught his eye; he winked to his companion and said, 'No, no; the young gentleman knows better.' Yes,' answered I, instantly fired; 'I know better than to give my money to sharpers' 'Sharpers!' retorted one 'Sharpers!' reechoed    the other, and began mutually to hustle me My valour was roused: I faced about, with the first blow laid the gentleman of Wales sprawling, and with the second made the captain's eyes strike fire. The attack was infinitely more vigorous and powerful than they could have expected. The Welsh gentleman shook his ears; the captain clapped his white handkerchief to his eyes. They swore a few oaths in concert, but neither of them seemed desirous to continue the combat. Such an attack from a stripling was quite out of all calculation. If however I could guess their motives from their manner, they were rather those of caution than of cowardice. Be that as it will, I could better deal out hard blows than utter coarse expressions, and I left them with a look of contempt.

But which should I choose; to be the pillar of the state, or the head of the hierarchy? a prime minister, or an archbishop? The question was embarrassing,    and it was not quite pleasant that I could not be both.  I did not however forget that I had first some few labours to perform; to which therefore, with all my might, I immediately applied. My busy brain had now fit employment, politics and divinity; but was puzzled with which to begin. The table at which I wrote was richly strewed with invectives, now hurled at state profligacy, now thundered against the nonconforming crew. It was my determination to spare neither friend nor foe. I often remembered the Zoilus Turl, and his heretical opinions; and was ready to exclaim, in the language of the patient Job, "Oh that his words were now written! Oh that they were printed in a book!" The dictatorial spirit of his reproof, for so I characterised it, had wounded me deeply; and, though I was not depraved enough to feel rancour, I ardently wished for the means to come, pen in hand, to a fair combat; for I    feared no mortal wight: if I had, he perhaps would have been the man. It will hereafter be seen that my wish was gratified.

He received me coldly, asked in a tone that did not wish for information how I liked London, and concluded with saying    he hoped I did not return to set the university any more bad examples! Not well satisfied myself with my methodistical paroxysm, I had not a word to offer in its defence. I answered, I hoped I should set no bad examples, either to the university or the world; but that I could only act to the best of my judgment, and if that deceived me I must endure the consequences. 'Exactly so, Mr. Trevor,' said the president, with a formal dismissing inclination of the head; and so we parted.  When I had been at college about a week, Hector Mowbray called on me one morning and told me his father was dead; that Mowbray Hall the manor and its demesnes were all his own; that he had the best pack of fox dogs in the county; hunters that would beat the world; setters as steady as a rifle barrel gun; and coursers that would take the wind in their teeth; and that he was going up to town with his sister, of whom    he was glad to be rid, to place her with an aunt.

I have oft be-dimm'd  The noon-tide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,  And 'twixt the green sea and the azur'd vault  Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder  Have I given fire, and rifted Jove's stout oak  With his own bolt: the strong-bas'd promontory  Have I made shake; and by the spurs pluck'd up  The pine and cedar: graves, at my command,  Have wak'd their sleepers; op'd, and let them forth  By my so potent art.  'I understand you,' said I; delighted with the picture he had drawn. 'Your necessities have obliged you to turn player?'  'Not altogether my necessities,' answered he: 'it was more from a frolic, and to know the world. That is my study, Mr. Trevor. But can you tell me why players, by following their profession, act    in some places contrary to all law, and are called strollers, vagabonds, and vagrants, and in others are protected by the law, and dignified with the high and mighty title of his Majesty's Servants?'  'Indeed I cannot,' said I.  He continued: 'Mark my words; the day will come, Mr. Trevor, when you will discover that there are greater jugglers in the world than your players, wonderful as their art of transformation is. The world is all a cheat; its pleasures are for him who is most expert in legerdemain and cajolery; and he is a fool indeed who is juggled out of his share of them. But that will not I be.'  He then turned the conversation to me, and what had happened during my visit in the country. I was beginning my short narrative, but we were interrupted by an acquaintance, who joined us; and we two or three times met again    in the billiard-room, before any opportunity presented itself.

My tragedy at length was written; and by some small number, whose judgment I consulted, was approved: never indeed with that enthusiasm which I, perhaps the overweening author, imagined it must have excited; but it was approved. "I was a young man of some merit; it was more than they had expected." Nay, I have met with some liberal critics, who have appeared modestly to doubt whether they themselves should have written better!  Before I made the experiment, I had supposed that every man, whose wealth    or power gave him influence in society, would start up, the moment it was known that an obscure individual, the usher of a school, had written a tragedy; not only to protect and produce it to the world, but to applaud and honour the author! Would secure him from the possibility of want, load him with every token of respect, and affectionately clasp him to their bosom! The indifference and foolish half-faced kind of wonder, as destitute of feeling as of understanding, with which it was received, by the persons on whom I had depended for approbation and support, did more than astonish me; it pained, disgusted, and jaundiced my mind!  The only consolation I could procure was in supposing that the inhabitants, of the city where I resided, were deficient in literary taste; and that at a more polished place, where knowledge literature and poetry were more diffused, I should meet a very different reception.    Experience only can cure the unhackneyed mind of its erroneous estimates!

My tragedy, after a number of rehearsals, during which all these vexatious incidents and many more were experienced by me, was at length performed. To say that the applause it received equalled my expectations would be false: but it greatly exceeded    the expectations of others. It was materially injured by the want of the actor who had refused his part. The reigning vice of recitation, which since the death of Garrick has again prevailed, injured it more. The tide of passion, which should have rushed in torrents and burst upon the astonished ear, was sung out in slow and measured syllables, with a monotonous and funeral cadence, painful in its motion, and such as reminded me of the Sloth and his horrid cry: plaintive indeed, but exciting strange disgust!  My success however was thought extraordinary. The actors when the play was over swarmed into the green-room, to congratulate me. The actresses were ready to kiss me; good natured souls! The green-room loungers, newspaper critics, authors, and pretended friends of the house flocked round me, to wish me joy and stare at that enviable animal a successful poet. One of them, himself an approved writer of comedy,    offered me five hundred pounds for the profits of my piece, and as far as money was concerned I thought my fortune was made: doubts and difficulties were fairly over, and the reward of all my toils was at last secure. Sanguine blockhead, thus everlastingly to embitter my own cup of sorrow! Secure? Oh no! The nectar of hope was soon dashed from my lips.

The wind again began to chafe, and swell, and seemed to mock at our distress. Still we repeated our efforts, whenever the wind paused: but, instead of voices intending to answer our calls, we heard shrill whistlings; which certainly were produced by men.  Could it be by good men? By any but night marauders; intent on mischief, but disturbed and alarmed? They were signals indubitably; for we shouted again, they were again given, and were then repeated from another quarter: at least, if they were not, they were miraculously imitated, by the dying away of the wind.  In a little while, we again heard the cur yelp; and immediately afterward a    howling, which was so mingled with the blast, that we could not tell whether it were the wind itself, the yelling of a dog, or the agonizing cries of a human voice: but it was a dreadfully dismal sound. We listened with perturbed and deep attention; and it was several times repeated, with increasing uncertainty, confusion, and terror.  What was to be done? My patience was exhausted. Danger itself could no longer detain me; and I told Clarke I was determined to make toward the village, or whatever the place was, from whence, dangerous and doubtful as they were, these various sounds proceeded.

Various conjectures instantly crossed my imagination; all of which were associated with the sudden flight from Bath, the robbery he had committed, the seeming honesty and even affection of his    character previous to that event, his now being in the service of Olivia, for I understood him to be her own valet, and the story of my death. But, though my curiosity was greatly excited, the present was not the time in which these mysteries could be unravelled. We therefore took Clarke's prescription against cold; and, leaving Cranford bridge, pursued our road to Hounslow: where we arrived about eleven o'clock, and put up at an inferior inn; left any accident should bring us again in company with the aunt and the nephew.

While we were walking, the care we were obliged to take, and the gloom around us, prevented any thing from escaping me sufficiently marked to attract the notice of my companion. But, when we were seated in a room with lights, and my mind was no longer diverted by other objects, the reveries into which I fell, the interjections that broke from me, the hasty and interrupted manner in which I ate and drank, the expressions of extreme joy which altered my countenance at one moment, and the solemn seriousness    which it assumed the next, with my eyes fixed, while the tears rolled down my cheeks, at last so agitated poor Clarke that he exclaimed "For God's sake, Mr. Trevor, what is the matter with you?"

One standard, by which he delighted to measure his own talents, was the length to which he could drawl out a reply.    Was there a man to be found who could speak eight hours unceasingly? He would surpass him. When his turn came, nine should not suffice. He would be more dull, contradictory, and intolerable, than his rival by an hour, at least. He would repeat precedents, twist sentences, misconstrue maxims, and so perplex and entangle his own intellect that his hearers had no way of getting rid of the pain he excited; except by falling a-sleep, or determining not to listen. It must be owned however he had some charity for them; for to sleep he gave them a very sufficient provocative.  Being one of the retainers of government, he had a seat in the House of Commons: where he used to rise in his place and address the Speaker, with no less logic, love of justice, and legislative wisdom, than he was wont to display when pleading in the courts.  It was in vain that he exposed himself to the ridicule of this most discerning body, not less witty than virtuous. Of shame he was incapable. He would again and again rise in his place, totally forgetful of past flagellation, and again and again convince Mr. Speaker and the honorable members: persisting to labour, in the hope of making them all as profound reasoners as himself. No matter that the thing was impracticable: he would get up and do his duty, and sit down and receive his own applause.

"As I understand the term, he certainly is: for, in addition to those manners and accomplishments which are most pleasing to the world, he not only possesses a good education but a sense of justice which makes him regard every man as his brother; and which will neither suffer him to crouch to the haughty nor trample on the poor."  "Why, that is very good. Very right. I myself will crouch to no man. And, as for modesty and humility, in the youth of the present day, why they are very rarely found: and so I shall be happy to meet with them."

He replied "To my house, Sir: or to any other lock up house that you choose."  "A lock up house, Sir!" said I. "Pray what is that ?"  The bailiff knew not how to give a direct answer; but replied "There is some lock up houses at which a gentleman may be treated like a gentleman: though I cannot say but there is others that is shabby enough. I see very well, Sir, you are a young gentleman, and do not know the trim of such things: so, if you please to go to my house, you will find very civil usage. I can tell by your    cut, Sir, that you are no scrub; so my wife will take care to furnish you with every thing that is genteel and polite."

And now let me request the reader to call to mind, not only my first emotions of love for Olivia, and the violence of the passion that preyed upon me while struggling between hope and despair, but those late testimonies of affection, such as a mind so dignified as hers could bestow; and then let him imagine what our meeting must be. Should he expect me to describe her, such as the was    and is, in all her attractions, all her beauties, and all her various excellence, he expects an impossible task. To be beloved by her, to be found worthy of her, and to call her mine, are blessings that infinitely exceed momentary rapture: they are lasting and indubitable happiness.  I know not if it will give him pleasure to be told that, could I have delighted in revenge, I might have satiated myself with that unworthy and destructive passion. The committee, appointed to decide on the election, voted the Idford candidate guilty of bribery and corruption. The fortune of the Earl, like that of Hector, has suffered depredations which half a century will probably not repair. The new made peer and his party daily became so obnoxious to the nation, by the destructive tendency of their measures, that they were and continue to be haunted by terrors that deprive them of the faculties common to man. My heart    bears witness for me that I do not speak this in triumph. I should be no less vicious than unworthy, could I triumph in the misfortunes of any human being: but I were a wretch indeed, were I to make mistakes that are the scourge of mankind a subject of exultation.

That I have amply provided for the generous minded Clarke? That Philip is once more the good and faithful servant of a kind mistress? That Mary and her son are equally objects of my attention? And that I do not mean to boast of these things as acts of munificence: but as the performance of duties?  This were unnecessary. Neither shall I be required to particularize the present happiness of Lydia, now Mrs. Wakefield; and of that man of brilliant and astonishing    faculties who is her affectionate companion and friend, and from whose exertions, if I am not strangely mistaken, the world has so much to profit and so much to expect. Like me, he is in the enjoyment of affluence; and he enjoys it with a liberal and munificent spirit. Are there any who hate him, because he once was guilty of hateful crimes? I hope not. It is a spirit that would sweep away half the inhabitants of the "peopled earth." For my own part, I delight in his conversation, am enlivened by his wit, and prompted to enquiry by the acuteness of his remarks. He is a man whom I am proud to say I love.  I have told my tale.

In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish the boy’s parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat.    The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.

We’ve made some money.”    The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.    “No,” the old man said. “You’re with a lucky boat. Stay with them.”    “But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big ones every day for three weeks.”    “I remember,” the old man said. “I know you did not leave me because you doubted.”    “It was papa made me leave. I am a boy and I must obey him.”    “I know,” the old man said. “It is quite normal.”    “He hasn’t much faith.”    “No,” the old man said. “But we have. Haven’t we?”    “Yes,” the boy said. “Can I offer you a beer on the Terrace and then we’ll take the stuff home.”    “Why not?” the old man said. “Between fishermen.”    They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he was not angry. Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad. But they did not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen.
HemiEOM.txt	14	20.0	1952	Hemingway, Ernest	The Old Man and the Sea	  The old man went out the door and the boy came after him. He was sleepy and the old man put his arm across his shoulders and said, “I am sorry.”        “Qué va,” the boy said. “It is what a man must do.”    They walked down the road to the old man’s shack and all along the road, in the dark, barefoot men were moving, carrying the masts of their boats.    When they reached the old man’s shack the boy took the rolls of line in the basket and the harpoon and gaff and the old man carried the mast with the furled sail on his shoulder.    “Do you want coffee?” the boy asked.    “We’ll put the gear in the boat and then get some.”    They had coffee from condensed milk cans at an early morning place that served fishermen.    “How did you sleep old man?” the boy asked. He was waking up now although it was still hard for him to leave his sleep.    “Very well, Manolin,” the old man said. “I feel confident today.”    “So do I,” the boy said. “Now I must get your sardines and mine and your fresh baits. He brings our gear himself. He never wants anyone to carry anything.”    “We’re different,” the old man said. “I let you carry things when you were five years old.”    “I know it,” the boy said. “I’ll be right back. Have another coffee. We have credit here.”    He walked off, barefooted on the coral rocks, to the ice house where the baits were stored. 
HemiEOM.txt	33	480.0	1952	Hemingway, Ernest	The Old Man and the Sea	  The fish never changed his course nor his direction all that night as far as the man could tell from watching the stars. It was cold after the sun went down and the old man’s sweat dried cold on his back and his arms and his old legs. During the day he had taken the sack that covered the bait box and spread it in the sun to dry. After the sun went down he tied it around his neck so that it hung down over his back and he cautiously worked it down under the line that was across his shoulders now. The sack cushioned the line and he had found a way of leaning forward against the bow so that he was almost comfortable. The position actually was only somewhat less intolerable; but he thought of it as almost comfortable.    I can do nothing with him and he can do nothing with me, he thought. Not as long as he keeps this up.        Once he stood up and urinated over the side of the skiff and looked at the stars and checked his course. The line showed like a phosphorescent streak in the water straight out from his shoulders. They were moving more slowly now and the glow of Havana was not so strong, so that he knew the current must be carrying them to the eastward. If I lose the glare of Havana we must be going more to the eastward, he thought. For if the fish’s course held true I must see it for many more hours. I wonder how the baseball came out in the grand leagues today, he thought. It would be wonderful to do this with a radio. Then he thought, think of it always. Think of what you are doing. You must do nothing stupid. 
HemiEOM.txt	43	5.0	1952	Hemingway, Ernest	The Old Man and the Sea	  “I don’t think I can eat an entire one,” he said and drew his knife across one of the strips. He could feel the steady hard pull of the line and his left hand was cramped. It drew up tight on the heavy cord and he looked at it in disgust.    “What kind of a hand is that,” he said. “Cramp then if you want. Make yourself into a claw. It will do you no good.”    Come on, he thought and looked down into the dark water at the slant of the line. Eat it now and it will strengthen the hand. It is not the hand’s fault and you have been many hours with the fish. But you can stay with him forever. Eat the bonito now.    He picked up a piece and put it in his mouth and chewed it slowly. It was not unpleasant.    Chew it well, he thought, and get all the juices. It would not be bad to eat with a little lime or with lemon or with salt.    “How do you feel, hand?” he asked the cramped hand that was almost as stiff as rigor mortis. “I’ll eat some more for you.”    He ate the other part of the piece that he had cut in two. He chewed it carefully and then spat out the skin.    “How does it go, hand? Or is it too early to know?”    He took another full piece and chewed it. 
HemiEOM.txt	44	5.0	1952	Hemingway, Ernest	The Old Man and the Sea	  “It is a strong full-blooded fish,” he thought. “I was lucky to get him instead of dolphin. Dolphin is too sweet. This is hardly sweet at all and all the strength is still in it.”    There is no sense in being anything but practical though, he thought. I wish I had some salt. And I do not know whether the sun will rot or dry what is left, so I had better eat it all although I am not hungry. The fish is calm and steady. I will eat it all and then I will be ready.    “Be patient, hand,” he said. “I do this for you.”    I wish I could feed the fish, he thought. He is my brother. But I must kill him and keep strong to do it. Slowly and conscientiously he ate all of the wedge-shaped strips of fish.    He straightened up, wiping his hand on his trousers.    “Now,” he said. “You can let the cord go, hand, and I will handle him with the right arm alone until you stop that nonsense.” He put his left foot on the heavy line that the left hand had held and lay back against the pull against his back.    “God help me to have the cramp go,” he said. “Because I do not know what the fish is going to do.”    But he seems calm, he thought, and following his plan. But what is his plan, he thought. And what is mine? Mine I must improvise to his because of his great size. If he will jump I can kill him. But he stays down forever. Then I will stay down with him forever. 
HemiEOM.txt	45	0.33320000000000005	1952	Hemingway, Ernest	The Old Man and the Sea	  He rubbed the cramped hand against his trousers and tried to gentle the fingers. But it would not open. Maybe it will open with the sun, he thought. Maybe it will open when the strong raw tuna is digested. If I have to have it, I will open it, cost whatever it costs. But I do not want to open it now by force. Let it open by itself and come back of its own accord. After all I abused it much in the night when it was necessary to free and untie the various lines.    He looked across the sea and knew how alone he was now. But he could see the prisms in the deep dark water and the line stretching ahead and the strange undulation of the calm. The clouds were building up now for the trade wind and he looked ahead and saw a flight of wild ducks etching themselves against the sky over the water, then blurring, then etching again and he knew no man was ever alone on the sea.    He thought of how some men feared being out of sight of land in a small boat and knew they were right in the months of sudden bad weather. But now they were in hurricane months and, when there are no hurricanes, the weather of hurricane months is the best of all the year. 
HemiEOM.txt	58	1.0	1952	Hemingway, Ernest	The Old Man and the Sea	  “I’ll lash the two oars together across the stern and that will slow him in the night,” he said. “He’s good for the night and so am I.”    It would be better to gut the dolphin a little later to save the blood in the meat, he thought. I can do that a little later and lash the oars to make a drag at the same time. I had better keep the fish quiet now and not disturb him too much at sunset. The setting of the sun is a difficult time for all fish.    He let his hand dry in the air then grasped the line with it and eased himself as much as he could and allowed himself to be pulled forward against the wood so that the boat took the strain as much, or more, than he did.    I’m learning how to do it, he thought. This part of it anyway. Then too, remember he hasn’t eaten since he took the bait and he is huge and needs much food. I have eaten the whole bonito. Tomorrow I will eat the dolphin. He called it dorado. Perhaps I should eat some of it when I clean it. It will be harder to eat than the bonito. But, then, nothing is easy. 
HemiEOM.txt	63	10.0	1952	Hemingway, Ernest	The Old Man and the Sea	      Back in the stern he turned so that his left hand held the strain of the line across his shoulders and drew his knife from its sheath with his right hand. The stars were bright now and he saw the dolphin clearly and he pushed the blade of his knife into his head and drew him out from under the stern. He put one of his feet on the fish and slit him quickly from the vent up to the tip of his lower jaw. Then he put his knife down and gutted him with his right hand, scooping him clean and pulling the gills clear. He felt the maw heavy and slippery in his hands and he slit it open. There were two flying fish inside. They were fresh and hard and he laid them side by side and dropped the guts and the gills over the stern. They sank leaving a trail of phosphorescence in the water. The dolphin was cold and a leprous gray-white now in the starlight and the old man skinned one side of him while he held his right foot on the fish’s head. Then he turned him over and skinned the other side and cut each side off from the head down to the tail. 
HemiEOM.txt	64	20.0	1952	Hemingway, Ernest	The Old Man and the Sea	  He slid the carcass overboard and looked to see if there was any swirl in the water. But there was only the light of its slow descent. He turned then and placed the two flying fish inside the two fillets of fish and putting his knife back in its sheath, he worked his way slowly back to the bow. His back was bent with the weight of the line across it and he carried the fish in his right hand.    Back in the bow he laid the two fillets of fish out on the wood with the flying fish beside them. After that he settled the line across his shoulders in a new place and held it again with his left hand resting on the gunwale. Then he leaned over the side and washed the flying fish in the water, noting the speed of the water against his hand. His hand was phosphorescent from skinning the fish and he watched the flow of the water against it. The flow was less strong and as he rubbed the side of his hand against the planking of the skiff, particles of phosphorus floated off and drifted slowly astern.    “He is tiring or he is resting,” the old man said. “Now let me get through the eating of this dolphin and get some rest and a little sleep.”    Under the stars and with the night colder all the time he ate half of one of the dolphin fillets and one of the flying fish, gutted and with its head cut off. 
HemiEOM.txt	67	3.0	1952	Hemingway, Ernest	The Old Man and the Sea	  He woke with the jerk of his right fist coming up against his face and the line burning out through his right hand. He had no feeling of his left hand but he braked all he could with his right and the line rushed out. Finally his left hand found the line and he leaned back against the line and now it burned his back and his left hand, and his left hand was taking all the strain and cutting badly. He looked back at the coils of line and they were feeding smoothly. Just then the fish jumped making a great bursting of the ocean and then a heavy fall. Then he jumped again and again and the boat was going fast although line was still racing out and the old man was raising the strain to breaking point and raising it to breaking point again and again. He had been pulled down tight onto the bow and his face was in the cut slice of dolphin and he could not move.    This is what we waited for, he thought. So now let us take it.    Make him pay for the line, he thought. Make him pay for it.    He could not see the fish’s jumps but only heard the breaking of the ocean and the heavy splash as he fell. The speed of the line was cutting his hands badly but he had always known this would happen and he tried to keep the cutting across the calloused parts and not let the line slip into the palm nor cut the fingers. 
HemiEOM.txt	68	5.0	1952	Hemingway, Ernest	The Old Man and the Sea	  If the boy was here he would wet the coils of line, he thought. Yes. If the boy were here. If the boy were here.    The line went out and out and out but it was slowing now and he was making the fish earn each inch of it. Now he got his head up from the wood and out of the slice of fish that his cheek had crushed. Then he was on his knees and then he rose slowly to his feet. He was ceding line but more slowly all the time. He worked back to where he could feel with his foot the coils of line that he could not see. There was plenty of line still and now the fish had to pull the friction of all that new line through the water.    Yes, he thought. And now he has jumped more than a dozen times and filled the sacks along his back with air and he cannot go down deep to die where I cannot bring him up. He will start circling soon and then I must work on him. I wonder what started him so suddenly? Could it have been hunger that made him desperate, or was he frightened by something in the night? Maybe he suddenly felt fear. But he was such a calm, strong fish and he seemed so fearless and so confident. It is strange. 
HemiEOM.txt	79	2.0	1952	Hemingway, Ernest	The Old Man and the Sea	  The old man looked carefully in the glimpse of vision that he had. Then he took two turns of the harpoon line around the bitt in the bow and laid his head on his hands.    “Keep my head clear,” he said against the wood of the bow. “I am a tired old man. But I have killed this fish which is my brother and now I must do the slave work.”    Now I must prepare the nooses and the rope to lash him alongside, he thought. Even if we were two and swamped her to load him and bailed her out, this skiff would never hold him. I must prepare everything, then bring him in and lash him well and step the mast and set sail for home.    He started to pull the fish in to have him alongside so that he could pass a line through his gills and out his mouth and make his head fast alongside the bow. I want to see him, he thought, and to touch and to feel him. He is my fortune, he thought. But that is not why I wish to feel him. I think I felt his heart, he thought. When I pushed on the harpoon shaft the second time. Bring him in now and make him fast and get the noose around his tail and another around his middle to bind him to the skiff. 
HemiEOM.txt	93	1.5	1952	Hemingway, Ernest	The Old Man and the Sea	  “They must have taken a quarter of him and of the best meat,” he said aloud. “I wish it were a dream and that I had never hooked him. I’m sorry about it, fish. It makes everything wrong.” He stopped and he did not want to look at the fish now. Drained of blood and awash he looked the colour of the silver backing of a mirror and his stripes still showed.    “I shouldn’t have gone out so far, fish,” he said. “Neither for you nor for me. I’m sorry, fish.”    Now, he said to himself. Look to the lashing on the knife and see if it has been cut. Then get your hand in order because there still is more to come.    “I wish I had a stone for the knife,” the old man said after he had checked the lashing on the oar butt. “I should have brought a stone.” You should have brought many things, he thought. But you did not bring them, old man. Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.    “You give me much good counsel,” he said aloud. “I’m tired of it.”    He held the tiller under his arm and soaked both his hands in the water as the skiff drove forward. 
HemiEOM.txt	107	2.0	1952	Hemingway, Ernest	The Old Man and the Sea	But we will fish together now for I still have much to learn.”    “We must get a good killing lance and always have it on board. You can make the blade from a spring leaf from an old Ford. We can grind it in Guanabacoa. It should be sharp and not tempered so it will break. My knife broke.”    “I’ll get another knife and have the spring ground. How many days of heavy brisa have we?”    “Maybe three. Maybe more.”    “I will have everything in order,” the boy said. “You get your hands well old man.”    “I know how to care for them. In the night I spat something strange and felt something in my chest was broken.”    “Get that well too,” the boy said. “Lie down, old man, and I will bring you your clean shirt. And something to eat.”    “Bring any of the papers of the time that I was gone,” the old man said.    “You must get well fast for there is much that I can learn and you can teach me everything. How much did you suffer?”    “Plenty,” the old man said.    “I’ll bring the food and the papers,” the boy said. “Rest well, old man. I will bring stuff from the drugstore for your hands.”    “Don’t forget to tell Pedrico the head is his.”    “No. I will remember.”    As the boy went out the door and down the worn coral rock road he was crying again. 
HemiEOM.txt	108	1.0	1952	Hemingway, Ernest	The Old Man and the Sea	  That afternoon there was a party of tourists at the Terrace and looking down in the water among the empty beer cans and dead barracudas a woman saw a great long white spine with a huge tail at the end that lifted and swung with the tide while the east wind blew a heavy steady sea outside the entrance to the harbour.    “What’s that?” she asked a waiter and pointed to the long backbone of the great fish that was now just garbage waiting to go out with the tide.    “Tiburon,” the waiter said. “Eshark.” He was meaning to explain what had happened.    “I didn’t know sharks had such handsome, beautifully formed tails.”    “I didn’t either,” her male companion said.    Up the road, in his shack, the old man was sleeping again. He was still sleeping on his face and the boy was sitting by him watching him. The old man was dreaming about the lions. 
ThacWV.txt	0	2.0	1848	Thackeray, William Makepeace	Vanity Fair	VANITY FAIR.  A NOVEL WITHOUT A HERO.  CHAPTER I.    CHISWICK MALL.  HILE the present century  was in its teens, and on  one sunshiny morning in  June, there drove up to  the great iron gate of Miss  Pinkerton's academy for  young ladies, on Chiswick  Mall, a large family coach,  with two fat horses in  blazing harness, driven by  a fat coachman in a three  cornered hat and wig, at  the rate of four miles an hour. A black servant, who  reposed on the box beside the fat coachman, uncurled his  bandy legs as soon as "the equipage drew up opposite Miss  Pinkerton's shining brass plate, and, as he pulled the bell,  at least a score of young heads were seen peering out of  the narrow windows of the stately old brick house. Nay,  the acute observer might have recognised the little red  nose of good-natured Miss Jemima Pinkerton herself, rising  over some geranium pots in the window of that lady's own  drawing-room.  "It is Mrs. Sedley's coach, sister, " said Miss Jemima.  "Sambo, the black servant, has just rung the bell; and the  coachman has a new red waistcoat."  "Have you completed all the necessary preparations  incident to Miss Sedley's departure, Miss Jemima?" asked  VOL. I. — i 1  2 VANITY FAIR.  Miss Pinkerton herself, that majestic lady; the Seniiramis  of Hammersmith, the friend of Dr. Johnson, the correspondent  of Mrs. Chapone herself.  "The girls were up at four this morning, packing her  trunks, sister, '' replied Miss Jemima; "we have made her  a bow pot."

"Well a booky as big almost as a haystack; I have put  up two bottles of the gillyflower water for Mrs. Sedley, and  the receipt for making it, in Amelia's box."    "And I trust, Miss Jemima, you have made a copy of  Miss Sedley's account. That is it, is it? Very good —  ninety three pounds, four shillings. Be kind enough to  address it to John Sedley, Esquire, and to seal this billet  which I have written to his lady."  In Miss Jemima's eyes an autograph letter of her sister,  Miss Pinkerton, was an object of as deep veneration as  would have been a letter from a sovereign. Only when  her pupils quitted the establishment, or when they were  about to be married, and once when poor Miss Birch died  of the scarlet fever, was Miss Pinkerton known to write  VANITY FAIR.  3  personally to the parents of her pupils; and it was  Jemima's opinion that if anything could console Mrs.  Birch for her daughter's loss, it would be that pious and  eloquent composition in which Miss Pinkerton announced  the event.  In the present instance Miss Pinkerton's "billet" was to  the following effect: —  "The Mali., Chiswick, June IS, IS — .

So he used to get  drunk every night: to beat his pretty Rose sometimes: to  leave her in Hampshire when he went to London for the    VANITY FAIR.  80  Parliamentary session, without a single friend in the wide  world. Even Mrs. Bute Crawley, the rector's wife, refused  to visit her, as she said she would never give the pas to a  tradesman's daughter.  As the only endowments with which Nature had gifted  Lady Crawley were those of pink cheeks and a white skin,  and as she had no sort of character, nor talents, nor opinions,  nor occupations, nor amusements, nor that vigour of soul and  ferocity of temper which often falls to the lot of entirely  foolish women, her hold upon Sir Pitt's affections was not  very great. Her roses faded out of her cheeks, and the  pretty freshness left her figure after the birth of a couple of  'children, and she became a mere machine in her husband's  house, of no more use than the late Lady Crawley's grand  piano. Being a light complexioned woman, she wore light  clothes, as most blondes will, and appeared, in preference, in  draggled seagreen, or slatternly sky blue. She worked that  worsted day and night, or other pieces like it. She had counterpanes  in the course of a few years to all the beds in Crawley.

"We are going to hunt him  out, sir — the duke's in Belgium already, and we expect  marching orders every day."  "Give him no quarter. Bring back the villain's head,  sir. Shoot the coward down, sir, " Sedley roared. "I'D  enlist myself, by — ; but I'M a broken old man — ruined by  that damned scoundrel — and by a parcel of swindling  thieves in this country whom I made, sir, and who are rolling  in their carriages now, " he added, with a break in his voice  VANITY FAIR. 223  Dobbin was not a little affected by the sight of this once  kind old friend, crazed almost with misfortune and raving  with senile anger. Pity the fallen gentleman: you to whom  money and fair repute are the chiefest good; and so, surely,  are they in Vanity Fair.  "Yes, " he continued, "there are some vipers that you  warm, and they sting you afterwards. There are some beggars  that you put on horseback, and they're the first to ride  you down. You know whom I mean, William Dobbin, my  boy. I mean a purse proud villain in Russell Square, whom  I knew without a shilling, and whom I pray and hope to  see a beggar as he was when I befriended him."

Her  face cleared up as she read the document, however. The  idea of sharing poverty and privation in company with the  beloved object is, as we have before said, far from being  disagreeable to a warmhearted woman. The notion was  actually pleasant to little Amelia. Then, as usual, she was  ashamed of herself for feeling happy at such an indecorous  moment, and checked her pleasure, saying, demurely, "Oh,  George, how your poor heart must bleed at the idea of being  separated from your papa."  "It does, " said George, with an agonised countenance.  "But he can't be angry with you long, " she continued.  "Nobody could, I'M sure. He must forgive you, my dearest,  kindest husband. Oh, I shall never forgive myself if  he does not."  "What vexes me, my poor Emmy, is not my misfortune,  but yours, " George said. "I don't care for a little poverty;  and I think, without vanity, I'Ve talents enough to make  my own way."  "That you have, " interposed his wife, who thought that  278  VANITY FAIR.  war should cease, and her husband should be made a general  instantly.

How elegant he looks! Me brother,  Molloy Malony, is as like him as two peas."  Rebecca did not make for the carriage; but as soon as  she perceived her old acquaintance Amelia seated in it, acknowledged  her presence by a gracious word and smile, and  by kissing and shaking her fingers playfully in the direction  of the vehicle. Then she resumed her conversation with  General Tufto, who asked "who the fat officer was in the  gold laced cap?" on which Becky replied, "that he was an    319  320  VANITY FAIR.  officer in the East Indian Service." But Rawdon Crawley  rode out of the ranks of his company, and came up and  shook hands heartily with Amelia, and said to Jos, "Well,  old boy, how are you?" and stared in Mrs. O'Dowd's face  and at the black cock's feathers until she began to think she  had made a conquest of him.  George, who had been delayed behind, rode up almost immediately  with Dobbin, and they touched their caps to the  august personages, among whom Osborne at once perceived  Mrs. Crawley. He was delighted to see Rawdon leaning  over his carriage familiarly and talking to Amelia, and met  the aide-de-camp's cordial greeting with more than corresponding  warmth. The nods between Rawdon and Dobbin  were of the very faintest specimens of politeness.

Many  scores of Begulus's comrades had found their way back to  Brussels, and — all agreeing that they had run away —  filled the whole town with an idea of the defeat of the  allies. The arrival of the French was expected hourly;    the panic continued, and preparations for flight went on  everywhere. No horses! thought Jos, in terror. He made  Isidor inquire of scores of persons, whether they had any to  lend or sell, and his heart sank within him at the negative  answers returned everywhere. Should he take the journey  on foot?

Amongst these would be fugitives, Jos remarked  the Lady Bareacres and her daughter, who sat in their carriage  in the port cochere of their hotel, all their imperials  packed, and the only drawback to whose flight was the same  want of motive power which kept Jos stationary.

It was in order to let the house  again that Raggles purchased it. As soon as a tenant was  found, he subsided into the green grocer shop once more;  but a happy thing it was for him to walk out of that tenement  and into Curzon Street, and there survey his house —  his own house — with geraniums in the window and a  carved bronze knocker. The footman occasionally lounging  at the area railing, treated him with respect; the cook took  her green stuff at his house, and called him Mr. Landlord;  and there was not one thing the tenants did, or one dish  which they had for dinner, that Raggles might not know of,  if he liked.  He was a good man; good and happy. The house brought  him in so handsome a yearly income, that he was determined  to send his children to good schools, and accordingly, regardless  of expense, Charles was sent to boarding at Dr.  Swishtail's, sugarcane Lodge, and little Matilda to Miss  Peckover's, Laurentinum House, Clapham.

It is  those who injure women who get the most kindness from  them — they are born timid and tyrants, and maltreat those  who are humblest before them.  So poor Amelia had been getting ready in silent misery  for her son's departure, and had passed many and many a  long solitary hour in making preparations for the end.  George stood by his mother, watching her arrangements  without the least concern. Tears had fallen into his boxes;  passages had been scored in his favourite books; old toys,  relics, treasures had been hoarded away for him, and  packed with strange neatness and care, — and of all these  things the boy took no note. The child goes away smiling  as the mother breaks her heart. By heavens, it is pitiful,  the bootless love of women for children in Vanity Fair.

I lived butler with Miss Crawley for thirty  years; and I little thought one of that family was a goin'  to ruing me — yes, ruing me " — said the poor fellow, with  tears in his eyes. " Har you a goin' to pay me ? You'Ve  lived in this 'ouse four year. You'Ve 'ad my substance:  my plate and linning.

" He's a charaty boy now, Cooky, " said Mr. Trotter, with  a drunken "ha! ha!" — and honest Eaggles continued, in  a lamentable tone, an enumeration of his griefs. All he  said was true. Becky and her husband had ruined him.  He had bills coming due next week, and no means to meet  them. He would be sold up and turned out of his shop  and his house, because he had trusted to the Crawley family.  His tears and lamentations made Becky more peevish than  ever.  "You all seem to be against me, " she said, bitterly.

" The claims I mean, are those left me by George's father, "  William said.  " Yes, and you insulted his memory. You did yesterday.  You know you did. And I will never forgive you. Never !"  said Amelia. She shot out each little sentence in a tremor  of anger and emotion.  " You don't mean that, Amelia ? " William said, sadly,  " You don't mean that these words, uttered in a hurried moment,  are to weigh against a whole life's devotion ? I think  that George's memory has not been injured by the way in  which I have dealt with it, and if we are come to bandying  reproaches, I at least merit none from his widow and the  mother of his son. Reflect, afterwards when — when you  are at leisure, and your conscience will withdraw this accusation.  It does even now." Amelia held down her head.  "It is not that speech of yesterday, " he continued,  " which moves you. That is but the pretext, Amelia, or I  have loved you and watched you for fifteen years in vain.

I wakened from my sleep, was sulky, but turned and slept  again. Biddlecombe the barrister I knew was the occupant  of the upper chamber. He came down the next morning  looking wretchedly yellow about the cheeks, and livid round  the eyes. His teething infant had kept him on the march  all night, and Mrs. Biddlecombe, I am told, scolds him  frightfully besides. He munched a shred of toast, and was  off by the omnibus to chambers. I chipped a second egg;  I may have tried one or two other nice little things on the  table (Strasbourg pate I know I never can resist, and am  convinced it is perfectly wholesome). I could see my own  sweet face in the mirror opposite, and my gills were as rosy  as any broiled salmon. " Well — well!" I thought, as  the barrister disappeared on the roof of the coach, " he has  domus and placens uxor — but is she placens ? Plaeetne to  walk about all night with a roaring baby ?

" Passionate outbursts of a grief stricken  heart!" — Passionate scrapings of a fiddlestick, my good  friend. "Lonely, " of course, rhymes with "only, " and  " gushes " with " blushes, " and " despair " with " hair, " and  so on. Despair is perfectly compatible with a good dinner,  I promise you.

When the doctor rose presently, saying he would go and  see the gardener's child, who was ill, and casting longing  looks at Miss Prior, I assure you I did not feel a tittle of  jealousy, though Miss Bessy actually followed Mr. Drencher  into the lawn, under the pretext of calling back Miss Cissy,  who had run thither without her bonnet.

We  drank too much, purposely. Nothing would do. "Hang  me, if I can stand this, Lovel, " I said, as we sat mum over  our third bottle. " I will go back and sleep at my chambers.  I was not a little soft upon her myself, that's the  truth. Here's her health, and happiness to both of you,  with all my heart." And we drained a great bumper  apiece, and I left him.

DefoDRM.txt	0	3153600.0	1724	Defoe, Daniel, 1660-1731	Roxana: The Fortunate Mistress	A HISTORY OF THE LIFE OF ROXANA      I was born, as my friends told me, at the city of Poitiers, in the  province or county of Poitou, in France, from whence I was brought to  England by my parents, who fled for their religion about the year 1683,  when the Protestants were banished from France by the cruelty of their  persecutors.    I, who knew little or nothing of what I was brought over hither for, was  well enough pleased with being here. London, a large and gay city, took  with me mighty well, who, from my being a child, loved a crowd, and to  see a great many fine folks.    I retained nothing of France but the language, my father and mother  being people of better fashion than ordinarily the people called  refugees at that time were; and having fled early, while it was easy to  secure their effects, had, before their coming over, remitted  considerable sums of money, or, as I remember, a considerable value in  French brandy, paper, and other goods; and these selling very much to  advantage here, my father was in very good circumstances at his coming  over, so that he was far from applying to the rest of our nation that  were here for countenance and relief. On the contrary, he had his door  continually thronged with miserable objects of the poor starving  creatures who at that time fled hither for shelter on account of  conscience, or something else. 
DefoDRM.txt	1	5781600.0	1724	Defoe, Daniel, 1660-1731	Roxana: The Fortunate Mistress	  I have indeed heard my father say that he was pestered with a great many  of those who, for any religion they had, might e'en have stayed where  they were, but who flocked over hither in droves, for what they call in  English a livelihood; hearing with what open arms the refugees were  received in England, and how they fell readily into business, being, by  the charitable assistance of the people in London, encouraged to work in  their manufactories in Spitalfields, Canterbury, and other places, and  that they had a much better price for their work than in France, and the  like.    My father, I say, told me that he was more pestered with the clamours of  these people than of those who were truly refugees, and fled in distress  merely for conscience.    I was about ten years old when I was brought over hither, where, as I  have said, my father lived in very good circumstances, and died in about  eleven years more; in which time, as I had accomplished myself for the  sociable part of the world, so I had acquainted myself with some of our  English neighbours, as is the custom in London; and as, while I was  young, I had picked up three or four playfellows and companions suitable  to my years, so, as we grew bigger, we learned to call one another  intimates and friends; and this forwarded very much the finishing me for  conversation and the world.

I saw him lay it down, and  understood what he meant, but I took no notice of it till I came to it,  as it were, casually; then I gave a great cry out, and fell a-scolding  in my way, for he gave me all possible freedom of speech on such  occasions. I told him he was unkind, that he would never give me an  opportunity to ask for anything, and that he forced me to blush by being  too much obliged, and the like; all which I knew was very agreeable to  him, for as he was bountiful beyond measure, so he was infinitely  obliged by my being so backward to ask any favours; and I was even with  him, for I never asked him for a farthing in my life.    Upon this rallying him, he told me I had either perfectly studied the  art of humour, or else what was the greatest difficulty to others was  natural to me, adding that nothing could be more obliging to a man of  honour than not to be soliciting and craving.    I told him nothing could be craving upon him, that he left no room for  it; that I hoped he did not give merely to avoid the trouble of being  importuned. I told him he might depend upon it that I should be reduced  very low indeed before I offered to disturb him that way. 
DefoDRM.txt	219	7.0	1724	Defoe, Daniel, 1660-1731	Roxana: The Fortunate Mistress	  He rose up with ceremony, and gave me thanks in terms that sufficiently  told me he had been bred among people more polite and more courteous  than is esteemed the ordinary usage of the Dutch; and after his  compliment was over he came nearer to me, and told me he was obliged to  assure me, though with repeated acknowledgments of my kind offer, that  he was not in any want of money; that he had met with no uneasiness in  any of his affairs--no, not of any kind whatever, except that of the  loss of his wife and one of his children, which indeed had troubled him  much; but that this was no part of what he had to offer me, and by  granting which I should balance all obligations; but that, in short, it  was that, seeing Providence had (as it were for that purpose) taken his  wife from him, I would make up the loss to him; and with that he held me  fast in his arms, and, kissing me, would not give me leave to say no,  and hardly to breathe.    At length, having got room to speak, I told him that, as I had said  before, I could deny him but one thing in the world; I was very sorry he  should propose that thing only that I could not grant. 
DefoDRM.txt	382	20160.0	1724	Defoe, Daniel, 1660-1731	Roxana: The Fortunate Mistress	  In this state of uncertainty, I say, by Amy's letter, I was like still  to remain another fortnight; and had I now continued the resolution of  using my merchant in the rude manner I once intended, I had made perhaps  a sorry piece of work of it indeed, and it was very well my heart failed  me as it did.    However, I treated him with a great many shuffles, and feigned stories  to keep him off from any closer conferences than we had already had,  that I might act afterwards as occasion might offer, one way or other.  But that which mortified me most was, that Amy did not write, though the  fourteen days were expired. At last, to my great surprise, when I was,  with the utmost impatience, looking out at the window, expecting the  postman that usually brought the foreign letters--I say I was agreeably  surprised to see a coach come to the yard-gate where we lived, and my  woman Amy alight out of it and come towards the door, having the  coachman bringing several bundles after her.    I flew like lightning downstairs to speak to her, but was soon damped  with her news. "Is the prince alive or dead, Amy?" says I. She spoke  coldly and slightly. "He is alive, madam," said she. "But it is not much  matter; I had as lieu he had been dead." So we went upstairs again to my  chamber, and there we began a serious discourse of the whole matter. 
DefoDRM.txt	460	20.0	1724	Defoe, Daniel, 1660-1731	Roxana: The Fortunate Mistress	  I thanked her very heartily for that part, and indeed she served me in  it more than I let her know she did: in a word, she thwarted the girl so  cleverly, that if she had known the whole affair she could not have  done it better.    But, I must acknowledge, all this put me upon the rack again, and I was  quite discouraged, not at all doubting but that the jade had a right  scent of things, and that she knew and remembered my face, but had  artfully concealed her knowledge of me till she might perhaps do it more  to my disadvantage. I told all this to Amy, for she was all the relief I  had. The poor soul (Amy) was ready to hang herself, that, as she said,  she had been the occasion of it all; and that if I was ruined (which was  the word I always used to her), she had ruined me; and she tormented  herself about it so much, that I was sometimes fain to comfort her and  myself too. 
DefoDRM.txt	463	120.0	1724	Defoe, Daniel, 1660-1731	Roxana: The Fortunate Mistress	  They paid their visit in form, and I received them as formally, but took  occasion two or three times to hint that I was so ill that I was afraid  I should not be able to go to Holland, at least not so soon as the  captain must go off; and made my compliment how sorry I was to be  disappointed of the advantage of their company and assistance in the  voyage; and sometimes I talked as if I thought I might stay till the  captain returned, and would be ready to go again; then the Quaker put  in, that then I might be too far gone, meaning with child, that I should  not venture at all; and then (as if she should be pleased with it)  added, she hoped I would stay and lie in at her house; so as this  carried its own face with it, 'twas well enough.    But it was now high time to talk of this to my husband, which, however,  was not the greatest difficulty before me; for after this and other chat  had taken up some time, the young fool began her tattle again; and two  or three times she brought it in, that I was so like a lady that she had  the honour to know at the other end of the town, that she could not put  that lady out of her mind when I was by, and once or twice I fancied the  girl was ready to cry; by and by she was at it again, and at last I  plainly saw tears in her eyes; upon which I asked her if the lady was  dead, because she seemed to be in some concern for her. She made me much  easier by her answer than ever she did before; she said she did not  really know, but she believed she was dead. 
DefoDRM.txt	464	10080.0	1724	Defoe, Daniel, 1660-1731	Roxana: The Fortunate Mistress	  This, I say, a little relieved my thoughts, but I was soon down again;  for, after some time, the jade began to grow talkative; and as it was  plain that she had told all that her head could retain of Roxana, and  the days of joy which I had spent at that part of the town, another  accident had like to have blown us all up again.    I was in a kind of dishabille when they came, having on a loose robe,  like a morning-gown, but much after the Italian way; and I had not  altered it when I went up, only dressed my head a little; and as I had  been represented as having been lately very ill, so the dress was  becoming enough for a chamber.    This morning vest, or robe, call it as you please, was more shaped to  the body than we wear them since, showing the body in its true shape,  and perhaps a little too plainly if it had been to be worn where any men  were to come; but among ourselves it was well enough, especially for hot  weather; the colour was green, figured, and the stuff a French damask,  very rich. 
DefoDRM.txt	485	5760.0	1724	Defoe, Daniel, 1660-1731	Roxana: The Fortunate Mistress	  "Well, my dear," says he, "if you should not be with child, though I  hope you are, yet there is no harm done; the staying three or four  months longer in England will be no damage to me, and we can go when we  please, when we are sure you are not with child, or, when it appearing  that you are with child, you shall be down and up again; and as for the  captain's wife and sister, leave that part to me; I'll answer for it  there shall be no quarrel raised upon that subject. I'll make your  excuse to them by the captain himself, so all will be well enough there,  I'll warrant you."    This was as much as I could desire, and thus it rested for awhile. I had  indeed some anxious thoughts about this impertinent girl, but believed  that putting off the voyage would have put an end to it all, so I began  to be pretty easy; but I found myself mistaken, for I was brought to the  point of destruction by her again, and that in the most unaccountable  manner imaginable.    My husband, as he and I had agreed, meeting the captain of the ship,  took the freedom to tell him that he was afraid he must disappoint him,  for that something had fallen out which had obliged him to alter his  measures, and that his family could not be ready to go time enough for  him. 
DefoDRM.txt	515	5.0	1724	Defoe, Daniel, 1660-1731	Roxana: The Fortunate Mistress	I had  before told her that she was a murderer, and a bloody-minded creature;  that she could not but know that I could not bear the thought of it,  much less the mention of it; and that it was the impudentest thing that  ever was known to make such a proposal to me, when she knew that I was  really the mother of this girl, and that she was my own child; that it  was wicked enough in her, but that she must conclude I was ten times  wickeder than herself if I could come into it; that the girl was in the  right, and I had nothing to blame her for; but that it was owing to the  wickedness of my life that made it necessary for me to keep her from a  discovery; but that I would not murder my child, though I was otherwise  to be ruined by it. Amy replied, somewhat rough and short, Would I not?  but she would, she said, if she had an opportunity; and upon these words  it was that I bade her get out of my sight and out of my house; and it  went so far that Amy packed up her alls, and marched off; and was gone  for almost good and all. But of that in its order; I must go back to her  relation of the voyage which they made to Greenwich together. 
DefoDRM.txt	568	480.0	1724	Defoe, Daniel, 1660-1731	Roxana: The Fortunate Mistress	  This took up the time till dinner, and when we were sitting together  after we had both dined, the captain came to tell us that the wind was  very fair, and that he was to sail at high water, which would be about  ten o'clock at night. My husband asked him to stay and drink part of a  bottle of wine with him, which he did; and their discourse being all in  the maritime strain, the Quaker and I retired and left them together,  for I had something to remind her of in our discourse before we left  London. When we got into the garden, which was rather neat than fine, I  repeated all my former requests to her about my children, Spitalfields,  Amy, &c., and we sat talking together till Thomas was sent to tell us  the captain was going, on which we returned; but, by the way, I kissed  her and put a large gold medal into her hand, as a token of my sincere  love, and desired that she would never neglect the things she had  promised to perform, and her repeated promise gave me great  satisfaction.    The captain, who was going out of the parlour as we returned in, was  telling my husband he would send six of his hands to conduct us to the  boat, about a quarter of an hour before he sailed, and as the moon was  at the full, he did not doubt of a pleasant passage. 
DefoDRM.txt	577	20160.0	1724	Defoe, Daniel, 1660-1731	Roxana: The Fortunate Mistress	  I was in this happy state of life when I wrote a letter to the Quaker,  in which I gave her a direction where she might send to me. And about a  fortnight after, as I was one afternoon stepping into my coach in order  to take an airing, the postman came to our door with letters, one of  which was directed to me, and as soon as I saw it was the Quaker's hand,  I bid the coachman put up again, and went into my closet to read the  contents, which were as follows:    "DEAR FRIEND,--I have had occasion to write to thee several times  since we saw each other, but as this is my first letter, so it  shall contain all the business thou wouldst know. I got safe to  London, by thy careful ordering of the coach, and the attendants  were not at all wanting in their duty. When I had been at home a  few days, thy woman, Mrs. Amy, came to see me, so I took her to  task as thou ordered me, about murdering thy pretended daughter;  she declared her innocence, but said she had procured a false  evidence to swear a large debt against her, and by that means had  put her into a prison, and fee'd the keepers to hinder her from  sending any letter or message out of the prison to any person  whatever. This, I suppose, was the reason thou thought she was  murdered, because thou wert relieved from her by this base usage.

The next reason was, that this marriage, to be performed as  soon as my son arrived there, would be a great satisfaction to his wife,  whose favourite the daughter was. "For," added he, "my wife will not  only have the pleasure of seeing her daughter settled on what was our  own hereditary estate, but also see her married to a man of substance,  without the danger of crossing the seas to be matched to a person equal  to herself."    "Pray, sir," said my lord, "let me hear what fortune you are willing to  give with your daughter; you have but two children, and I know you must  be rich." "Why, my lord," replied the planter, "there is no denying  that; but you must remember I have a son as well as a daughter to  provide for, and he I intend to turn into the mercantile way as soon as  he arrives safe from Virginia. I have, my lord," continued he, "a very  large stock-in-trade there, as warehouses of tobacco, &c., lodged in the  custom-houses of the ports, to the value of £7000, to which I will add  £3000 in money, and I hope you will look upon that as a very competent  estate; and when the young gentleman's fortune is joined to that, I  believe he will be the richest man in the whole American colonies of his  age." 
DefoDRM.txt	645	241920.0	1724	Defoe, Daniel, 1660-1731	Roxana: The Fortunate Mistress	  I proposed to Isabel to remove from lodgings and retire to Amsterdam,  where I was not known, and might turn myself into some little way of  business, and work for that bread now which had been too often  squandered away upon very trifles. And upon consideration I found myself  in a worse condition than I thought, for I had nothing to recommend me  to Heaven, either in works or thoughts; had even banished from my mind  all the cardinal and moral virtues, and had much more reason to hide  myself from the sight of God, if possible, than I had to leave The  Hague, that I might not be known of my fellow-creatures. And farther to  hasten our removing to Amsterdam, I recollected I was involved in debt  for money to purchase a share in the Newfoundland trader, which was  lost, and my creditors daily threatened me with an arrest to make me pay  them.    I soon discharged my lodgings and went with Isabel to Amsterdam, where I  thought, as I was advanced in years, to give up all I could raise in the  world, and on the sale of everything I had to go into one of the  Proveniers' houses, where I should be settled for life. But as I could  not produce enough money for it, I turned it into a coffee-house near  the Stadt-house, where I might have done well; but as soon as I was  settled one of my Hague creditors arrested me for a debt of £75, and I  not having a friend in the world of whom to raise the money, was, in a  shameful condition, carried to the common jail, where poor Isabel  followed me with showers of tears, and left me inconsolable for my great  misfortunes. Here, without some very unforeseen accident, I shall never  go out of it until I am carried to my grave, for which my much-offended  God prepare me as soon as possible.

Whether it was from a thorough sense of her wretched state, or any other  reason, I could never learn; but this I may say, that she was a sincere  penitent, and in every action had all the behaviour of a Christian. By  degrees all the things she had in the world were sold, and she began to  find an inward decay upon her spirits. In this interval she repeated all  the passages of her ill-spent life to me, and thoroughly repented of  every bad action, especially the little value she had for her children,  which were honestly born and bred. And having, as she believed, made her  peace with God, she died with mere grief on the 2nd of July 1742, in the  sixty-fifth year of her age, and was decently buried by me in the  churchyard belonging to the Lutherans, in the city of Amsterdam.

Towards the close of one of those beautiful  days with which the golden month  of August gladdens the heart of the agriculturist,  Mr. Byngham sallied forth to  enjoy the pleasure of an evening's ride.  This gentleman was on a solitary tour to  the lakes of Westmoreland and Cumberland,  and had spent much time in rocky  Keswick and its vicinity. In his excursions  from thence, he had viewed with  alternate sensations of awe and admiration,  Wallow Cragg, Skiddaw, Helvellyn,  and the rocks of Borrowdale ;    B      2 CONCEALMENT.    the various beautiful lakes and petrifying  cascades ; with the variety of scenes in  which horror, beauty, and magnificence,  here combine to astonish the observing  stranger.    Still his curiosity was ungratified ; or  rather he was unwilling to quit a scene  whose ceaseless variations detached his  thoughts from subjects of a more near and  painful nature.    Fascinated by the surrounding objects,  he was slowly proceeding along the side  of Derwentwater, when the melancholy  that had stolen over his mind was forcibly  checked, and his attention ri vetted by a  sight that chilled his soul with horror. 
Anon2C.txt	1	1.0	1821	anonymous	Concealment	  An immense craggy rock, a few yards  before him, shaded the path, and projected  some way over the water. On a  ridge, formed by a rugged protuberance  of this tremendous mass, lay a child, who  had evidently fallen from the top of the  rock, and, almost miraculously, lodged on  this dangerous resting place, which was      CONCEALMENT. 3    too narrow to give any hope of safety  but as long as the infant, who lay stunned  by the fall, should continue motionless.  Higher up, among the trees, appeared a  female clasping with convulsive grasp  another child to her bosom, while the  frantic screams with which she rent the  air spoke her agony and distraction.    Mr. Byngham looked eagerly round  for means to extricate the infant from its  perilous situation ; but in vain. The  height and projection of the rock put all  assistance beyond his power. No boat  was to be seen on the lake, and he vainly  listened for the sound of the friendly oar :  all around was still as night ; interrupted  only by the cries of the woman, reechoed,  in terrific tones, by the neighbouring  rocks.    The benevolent heart of Byngham was  wrung with pity at the dreadful situation  of the child, who, should he absent  himself in quest of assistance, might in  the meanwhile find a watery grave,  b2      4 CONCEALMENT.

The consequences were such as Mr.  Byngham had vainly endeavoured to  guard against, and his hopes of becoming  a father frustrated for the present ; a  circumstance that greatly aifected him,  but which he saw, with pain, was  scarcely felt by his wife. He had not,  however, long to lament this disappointment  : Mrs. Byngham again became  pregnant, and he now resolved to exert  his authority to prevent, if possible, a  repetition of his late vexation.    In pursuance of this determination, he  obliged his reluctant wife to remain quiet  in Hertfordshire till the birth of the infant.  He also drove from Austenbury  (the name of his seat, ) every one who      CONCEALMENT. 55    would have promoted dissipated amusement,  and restrained Louisa from all  violent exercise, that might have again  endangered his hopes. The incessant  contentions occasioned by these proceedings,  placed this young couple on the  most unhappy terms. The lady was disappointed  at not having the uncontrolled  command of hei actions, and her husband's  fortune ; for such were the gratifications  which the prospect of this union  had always presented to her wishes.  The esteem and friendship of the man  for whom she professed a preference, the  cultivation of her own mind, and the  interesting duties of a married life, were  scarcely objects of her attention. Mr.

These communications, extorted from  Mr. Byngham, and made with considerable  agitation and confusion, struck Frederick  very forcibly; and, feeling indefinite  suspicions rising in his mind, he hastened  to question his friend and instructor, on  a subject which had hitherto disappointed  his most anxious inquiries. Mr. Der  mont, easily reading in our hero's countenance  his perturbation, judged this was  not a favourable time for the unreserved  disclosure, which Lady Montrevor, Mr.  Byngham, and himself, had always considered  would be unavoidable when  Frederick's years and judgement were more  matured. Still, therefore, wishing  to spare his feelings, and delay an explanation,  which, — being involved in much  mystery, and so many suspicious appearances,  — could not fail to harass his mind,  Mr. Dermont endeavoured gently to check      230 CONCEALMENT.    his awakened curiosity. While, then, he  avoided all misrepresentations, he spoke  with such deliberation and apparent openness  of Mrs. Lawrence, of Mr. Byngham's  steady friendship for her, and of that  gentleman's paternal affection for her  children, that his pupil's unsettled suspicions  were, for the time, wholly lost in  the warmth of gratitude and regard for  the man who had protected his own and  Julia's infancy.

By none of these fair expectants were  the pleasures of the evening so impatiently  anticipated as by Julia. At her  solicitation, the arrangement of her own      CONCEALMENT. 237    and Miss Montrevor's dress, (which it  was agreed should correspond, ) was entrusted  to her taste ; and, for the first  time in her life, she sat down seriously to  study what would be most elegant and  becoming. 
Anon2C.txt	173	180.0	1821	anonymous	Concealment	  Dr. Thornton fully sympathised in      CONCEALMENT. 277    these feelings ; and, desiring Stephen to  attend his mother and sisters, left this  uncongenial scene with all possible haste.  When the gay throng appeared to relax  in dancing, they were invited to return  to the saloon, round which sofas  were placed, and refreshments of ail  descriptions supplied ; and , here Lady  Maria, assisted by the earl and her brother,  distributed her attention with all  the patience and condescension she could  command. Lady Eleanor had retired ;  fatigued, it was supposed, by having  danced a good deal.    The couch on which, by the exertions  of Frederick, Miss Montrevor, with Julia  and Miss Huntley, were seated, was  soon surrounded by the gentlemen who  had most distinguished them during the  evening ; among whom was Mr. Fair  bank, a young man of a noble family  and large fortune, whose person was too  remarkable to pass unnoticed. His stature  was diminutive, and his appearance      278 CONCEALMENT.    a just mirror of his truly contemptible  mind ; an attention to dress being nearly  the sole object that engrossed it. The  occasion of his present visit to Brookdale  had been to recommend himself to Lady  Maria : but a very few hours convinced  him he had no chance of success, and he  told his valet the first day, while dressing,  that " she would not suit ; " and that,  in spite of his father's wishes and directions,  he should endeavour to please his  own taste in another quarter. 
Anon2C.txt	192	60.0	1821	anonymous	Concealment	  Lord Montrevor was pleased to find  her prepared to preside at his breakfast ;  and, being joined by several of his friends,  with Edward Byngham, much lively  conversation passed. Some of the party  observed, that the early appearance of  Miss Lawrence, as well as her unaffected  cheerfulness, proved that, while she had  won numerous hearts, she had been      306 CONCEALMENT.    careful to preserve her own. Others  contended that, as sleep often fled the  lover's pillow, they might owe the pleasure  of the lady's company to her inability  to rest. To this Julia good humouredly  replied, — "Had I been aware, gentlemen,  that my presence would have excited  so much surprise, I think you would  not have seen me."    Much more agreeable badinage passed,  of which Julia was the soul ; and never,  perhaps, had she appeared more lovely  than while she thus continued to indulge  a natural flow of spirits, emanating from  a heart as free from care, as from every  unamiable passion. Edward Byngham  felt the effect of these attractions in an  unusual degree ; and, if he did not at that  moment forget Caroline, he drew a comparison  calculated to shake the preference  his heart had begun to feel for his  cousin.    The mind of this youth, as has been  before observed, gave no promise of      CONCEALMENT. 307    strength or fortitude. He was easily influenced  by the opinions and examples of  his associates ; in the choice of whom he  was often biassed by selfish considerations.

No one ever applied to her  in vain ; and, though her charity was  often too indiscriminate. Lady Montrevor  sought not to impress upon her, or Caroline,  the prudence of too nice an examination  into the merits or necessities of  the objects who sought relief; as she  well knew that an increasing knowledge  of the world, and painful experience,  would soon check the now ready hand,  and chill, at least in a degree, the glowing  flame of youthful charity.    From the above combining causes,  Julia was therefore in general very poor ;  but she was at this period '' passing  rich." Prudent foresight had made her  lately withstand temptation. Nothing  had been laid out in whims of either dress      concjEalment. 423    or fancy, and Ursula had received no  presents for some months. Even her  charities had been curtailed as closely as  her feeling heart would permit.    The result of all this self-denial was a  well stored small silk purse, which Julia  had determined to convey secretly into  some of Frederick's packages, with a  note, urging him, by his love for her, to  accept a gift which to her was of no use,  and might, on some unforeseen occasion,  be serviceable to him. The opportunity  before her was most unexpectedly favourable,  and she lifted up the lid, and found  the portmanteau was completely packed. 
Anon2C.txt	269	30.0	1821	anonymous	Concealment	  Frederick pressed her affectionately to  his bosom, and thanked her for this testimony  of her regard for him ; then solemnly  assured her, that, in concealing  from her circumstances respecting their  unhappy mother, some of which were  most painful, and all very mysterious, he  had been solely actuated by the desire of  preserving her from needless grief. ^' And,  would you now be content to seek to  know no more, you would avoid great  uneasiness." He said this without much  hope that anything less than the disclosure  of all he knew would satisfy the      430 CONCEALMENT.    awakened curiosity of Julia; he was,  therefore, not disappointed when she  protested that only an unreserved communication  of every particular with which  he was acquainted, and his suffering her  to examine the contents of the casket,  could restore her reliance on his affection,  and prevail on her to pardon his having  refused his confidence to a sister who  loved him so entirely that every thought  and feeling of her heart had ever been  open to his inspection.    Thus pressed, Frederick had no alternative,  and he reluctantly gave her without  reserve an account of all that had  passed between Mr. Byngham, Lady  Montrevor, Mr. Dermont, and himself,  respecting Mrs. Laurence, her death,  their own destitute situation, cc. He  would willingly have refrained from noticing  the opinion that he believed Mr.  Dermont entertained of her mother's character,  and which Mr. Byngham never  had been able to remove ; but Julia was      CONCEALMENT. 431    too attentive and quick sighted not to  penetrate her brother's fears.

Lately,  however, Selwyn's conduct had contradicted  that idea; and when Caroline  would now gaily have treated it as a  lover's quarrel, Julia seemed alternately  so distressed, mortified, and indignant,  that Miss Montrevor affectionately told  her she would think just what she wished  she should do on the subject ; adding,  *' When our kind mother, my dear Julia,  has an opportunity of talking the matter  over with you, she will set all things in a  proper point of view."    Julia, with momentary haughtiness,  said, indeed she had nothing to communicate  to Lady Montrevor : but the next  minute, with tearful eyes, she affectionately  embraced Caroline, saying, — "Oh!  yeg, I shall doubtless tell her, I have been  extremely foolish : but it was only for a  diort time ; and she will not, I know, re      CONCEALMJBINT. §@jf    prove me very severely, vs^hen she learns  how much I blame myself."

Frederick never wholly  surmounted his deep rooted afflictions ;  and never did his heart for a moment  feel a wish to give a rival to the memory  of the loved and lamented object of his  early and latest affection. Through life  he continued a model of integrity, honour,  and benevolence. The enthusiastic  ardour of sensibility, — which in youth      CONCEALMENT. 455    had glowed at his heart, ere he had  scarcely attained to manhood, — had settled  down into a warm and far extended  philanthropy. By his sister and Selwyn  he was almost idolised, and, in them and  their rising family, he felt that all the joy  he could ever taste would centre.    The happiness of Selwyn and Julia  was great and permanent ; for it was  founded on virtue. Julia soon ceased  to be an angel ; but ever remained a  lovely affectionate woman, — the partner  of her husband's cares, — and sometimes  his gentle and unobtrusive directress,  when occasions called forth the exercise  of her naturally correct judgement, or  awakened the instinctive and equally unerring  suggestions of her feeling heart.    Selwyn — whose virtues were, to superficial  observation, neither brilliant nor  ostentatious, but peculiarly adapted to  all the varied and rational enjoyments of  domestic life, — was highly sensible of  his favoured lot ; and, as the engaging      456 CONCEALMENT.    qualities of Julia's character and temper  were successively developed in the duties  of wife and mother, his past fastidiousness  of disposition was siipej^seded  by unbounded confidence and increasing  esteem.

He was, indeed, a man of liberal  views ; a Radical, even, in the sense that,  despising ready made formulas and loving  realities, he went to the root of every question  that he pretended to touch ; a Republican,  if you wish, in his political ideals ; and as for  religion, though he was "neither an atheist  nor an agnostic, he had convictions of his  own which prevented him from finding the  least spiritual satisfaction in the ceremonial  religion of the Russian Church. In so far,  then, he was perhaps of the same stuff as the  active members of the revolutionary party ;  but in so far only. For of the aims, the  methods, and the cardinal principles of the  revolutionists he totally disapproved.

The sky was  completely overcast with leaden, low hanging  clouds. The atmosphere was dim with a fine  bluish mist. And though it was not raining  now, I could see from the water in the street  that it had been doing so during the night.  The Park stretched away in front of me,  dark green and distinct in the foreground,  but ashen and blurred by the mist in the  distance ; and it sent forth from its wet turf  and dripping trees a crowd of racy penetrating  odours. My head ached, and every      156 MEA CULPA.    nerve in my body seemed to be on edge, and  in my breast, like a weight, there lay a dull  feeling of depression and of apprehension ; and  the sight of the cool shadowy Park, and the  smell of it, tempted me, so that I thought, ' I  will go out and walk there. It will soothe  me and refresh me.'    I entered by the gate opposite Salchester  House, and struck straight across the wet  greensward, in the direction of Kensington  Gardens. The air was exquisitely keen and  sweet ; it was intensely quiet, save for the  rustling of the leaves in the breeze and the  occasional piping of a bird ; and with the  exception of a desultory keeper or two, the  place appeared deserted. 
HarlHM.txt	401	3.5	1891	Harland, Henry,	Mea culpa	There are two ways of looking at the  question of killing a man. There is the  transcendental sentimental way, and there is  the way of reason and of common-sense. If  you are a sentimental transcendentalist, as  I am afraid you are, you may say of each  separate human life that it is an awful and a  sacred mystery, that it comes into being willynilly,  we know not whence, or why, or to what  end, and that therefore to tamper with it is  to tamper with the secret things of the  Unknowable. That is one view ; perhaps it  is your view ; if so, to be consistent, you  would not believe yourself entitled to kill  another man even in self-defence, and you  would wish to see malefactors go unhanged.  It is a permissible view, but it is scarcely the  view of common-sense, and it is certainly not    VOL. in. 41      194 MEA CULPA.    the view taken by society. Society has  agreed from time immemorial that under  various circumstances it is entirely justifiable  to put men to death ; and death dealing  machinery is a part and parcel of society's  regular equipment, sword arms and fire  arms, gallows and guillotines. If I am a  soldier, and you are an enemy, and I shoot  you down in battle, who dreams of blaming  me ? If I am a mere civilian, and you  attack me, am I not authorised by public  opinion and by the laws of the land to kill  you to protect myself ? That is the view of  the subject taken by most sane inhabitants  of the civilised world : that there is justifiable  homicide as well as unjustifiable homicide :  in other words, that the killing of a man is  not per southeast criminal, but that it depends for its  moral quality upon the particular circum  stances of the particular case.

R. L. Stine, J. K. Rowling, Suzanne Collins, and so many others had yet to come along. In fact, what we now know as the young adult genre had yet to be invented. Back then, at least for me, it was Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew. A limited selection, but what gems those tales were—each loaded with action, adventure, secrets, and conspiracies. Wondrous stories to fuel young imaginations. I devoured them.    Then one day when I was sixteen years old, a friend handed me a dog-eared paperback copy of Hawaii by James Michener. Its thousand pages immediately intimidated me, as did the small print. I’d never seen so much information packed into one book. The opening sentence alone contained thirty-six words—monstrous in comparison to the prose of Franklin W. Dixon. 
MichJC.txt	111	15.0	1974	Michener, James A	Centennial	  How beautiful she was as she took that painful journey, how gracefully coordinated her movements as she swam toward the chalk cliff. She moved as if she owned the earth and conferred grace upon it. She was the great final sum of millions of years of development. Slowly, swaying from side to side with majestic delicacy, she made her way to the swamp that lay at the foot of the cliff.    There she hesitated, twisting her great neck for the last time as if to survey her kingdom. Thirty feet above the earth her small head towered in one last thrust. Then slowly it lowered; slowly the graceful arc capsized. The tail dragged in the mud and the massive knees began to buckle. With a final surge of determination, she moved herself ponderously and without grace into a deep eddy.    Its murky waters crept up her legs, which would never again be pulled forth like reeds; this was the ultimate capture. The torn side went under; the tail submerged for the last time, and finally even the lovely arc of her neck disappeared. The knobby protuberance holding her nose stayed aloft for a few minutes, as if she desired one last lungful of the heavy tropical air, then it too disappeared. She had gone to rest, her mighty frame imprisoned in the muck that would embrace her tightly for a hundred and thirty-six million years.

But the bird was driven by deep inner compulsion and felt obligated to kill its enemy, so it flapped its great wings slowly and hovered above the cactus spines, lowering itself until its curved talons could catch the serpent again.    This time the eagle flew in wide circles, searching for an area of jagged rocks on which to drop the rattler. Locating what she wanted, she flapped her wings and rose to a great height and shook the snake free, watching with satisfaction as it crashed onto the rocks. The fall did great damage, and the snake should have been dead, but like all rattlers he had a terrible determination to survive, so as soon as he struck the rocks he marshaled his remaining strength and took the coiled position.    The eagle had made a sad miscalculation in dropping the snake onto the rocks, for she had counted upon the fall to kill him outright, but this it had not done, so now she was forced to leave the flat, sandy terrain where she had an advantage and go among the rocks, where the advantage was his. However, since the snake was obviously close to death, she judged that she could quickly finish him off. 
MichJC.txt	752	30240.0	1974	Michener, James A	Centennial	  A fearful quiet settled over the region, with white men afraid to venture far from their homes and with streets in the city barricaded against possible invasion. When rumors of a beginning assault flashed through the city, citizens broke into the army ordnance warehouse and commandeered rifles, then patrolled the streets. This was not childish apprehension but an understandable fear that Indians might soon be invading the city. After all, Colorado had fewer than three hundred soldiers to protect the whole territory, and if the Indians wanted to pick off isolated farms, they could do so almost at will.    On July 26, 1864, a rancher living east of the village of Zendt’s Farm saw Indians making off with two of his cows, which they slaughtered four miles from his home. This time there was no uncertainty as to what had happened or who the culprits were, so once more Lieutenant Tanner and his riders scoured the prairie and once more they encountered a community of tipis pitched where they should not have been. It was hardly likely that the cow-stealers were lodged in this particular place, but Tanner and his men surrounded it and with a howitzer gunned down forty-seven Indians. 
MichJC.txt	807	7200.0	1974	Michener, James A	Centennial	  But finally Skimmerhorn tightened the noose, leaving the Pasquinels diminishing territory in which to maneuver, and one wintry morning along the Platte, about twenty miles east of Zendt’s Farm, a detachment of militia surprised Jake and pinioned his arms before he could shoot himself. Messengers were sent to the colonel with the stirring news: “Jake Pasquinel has been taken.”    Skimmerhorn reached the scene about two o’clock in the afternoon, and within ten minutes, convened a drumhead court-martial. “Guilty,” the men said unanimously, and no juster verdict was ever reached along the Platte. Two men threw a rope over a cottonwood branch, tied it around Jake Pasquinel’s neck and dragged him aloft. The knot had been poorly tied, and for an unbelievably long time he kicked and twisted, strangling slowly as the militia cheered.    That night word of the hanging reached Zendt’s Farm, and Levi got a shovel, saddled up a horse, kissed Lucinda goodbye and rode east to cut down the body and bury it. When word of this circulated through the region, it infuriated the Skimmerhorn people, who judged it a rebuke to their triumph, and they were so enraged that a squaw man should have done this thing, they stormed down to the stockade and set it afire.    Stolidly Zendt watched as the flames consumed his home, then had the bitter experience of being turned away by four different neighbors before he found one who would give him and his wife shelter for that night.

Makes ’em think the old days are still here.” He told Gompert, “If you lost only one horse, it was cheap,” but Gompert wanted to know if he could ride out with a scouting party, to see if he could recover his horse.    “Son, forget it! You’ll have real problems on your hands if the Comanche decide to move westward.”    “Where are they now?” Poteet asked.    “Our scouts have them spotted way to the east. North of Texas in the Indian country. But they could be moving west. I’d take my cattle over to the west bank. Forget the Apaches and keep an eye out pretty firmly to the east.”    Now Nacho Gómez sprang his surprise regarding the calves. Asking for a horse, he spoke with some of the soldiers, then rode directly west into Apache country. Some hours later he returned with a dozen Mexican farmers leading a horse laden with trading goods. Going to his wagon, he produced the three calves, and the Mexicans groaned with delight. “A bull!” one cried, and Mr. Poteet watched as Nacho entered into frenetic bargaining. 
MichJC.txt	981	4.0	1974	Michener, James A	Centennial	  There was a brief interlude of excited chatter as they all compared notes on their kills. Suddenly someone noticed, moving parallel to the coach, a splendid bull with massive head held low, great shoulders and a sloping rear well adapted to fast charges. He could hardly have been important in the servicing of cows, for surely younger bulls must have driven him away by now, but he had a notable dignity which the German watercolorist tried to catch. “What an animal!” he cried as he rapidly started to sketch the sloping shoulders and drooping head.    Charlotte could not remember later who uttered the cry, but someone shouted, “It’s for Miss Charlotte,” and a special gun, an Austrian one with a powerful sight, was handed to her, but again she refused.    “Please!” the Austrian duke cried. “You may never have another chance …”    “She doesn’t want it,” a quiet voice said, and Charlotte saw with relief that it was Oliver Seccombe. He took the heavy gun and handed it to one of the Russians.    “I’ll take him!” the Russian duke bellowed, but the pace of the bull matched exactly the speed of the train, and for more than a minute the grizzled old veteran moved beside the window, close enough to be touched but too close for a sporting shot.

But if we build tunnels up in the mountains and bring water that’s now wasted on the other side where it isn’t needed over to our side where it is …”    “Now he wants to dig under mountains,” one of the Sterling men said, and again Brumbaugh shouted, “That’s right. That’s just what I want to do. When the Platte flows past my farm I want it to be as big as the Mississippi, and when it leaves Colorado to enter Nebraska, I want it to be bone-dry. This valley can be the new Eden.”    To accomplish what he had in mind, Brumbaugh had to devise a miracle which would have disheartened a lesser man. “What do you want to do?” a lawyer asked him one day. “Change the laws?”    “That’s exactly what I want to do,” Potato cried. And with the assistance of an impecunious but brainy lawyer from the Greeley colony, he set out to do it.

When she arrived in Bristol she understood. Earl Venneford was a very old man, and he had sold all his stock in the ranch except one large block, which he intended deeding to Charlotte, whose mother had been related to him. When Charlotte visited him to pay her respects she found him painfully thin, bundled up in tweeds, but bright of eye.    “You’re a spunky girl,” he said. “I’m giving you my share of the ranch. I want to think of those wild acres as belonging to someone who will appreciate them.” He asked what her plans were, and when she proved vague, he said, “Find yourself a good man … someone who’s served in India … or an army man with African experience. How old are you?”    “Thirty-six.”    “Prime of life. Woman’s never better. Has some sense to go along with her beauty, and you always were a beauty, Charlotte.” Then he asked bluntly, “Was it Seccombe who stole our money out there?”    “He stole nothing. He managed the ranch well, and if the blizzards hadn’t come …”    “I’ve found that blizzards usually do come,” he said.

The railroad had every incentive to get the train into Chicago on time, and the evil old habit of sidetracking without regard to the welfare of the animals was forbidden. Of course, if an unavoidable delay occurred, then Gregg and Calendar would become important, for they would have to unload the animals, see that they moved about and provide them with water.    “Nineteen trips out of twenty, nothin’ happens,” the brakemen assured the two guardians. “Sit back and enjoy the ride.”    There were nine men in the large caboose, with sleeping bunks for five. There were four regulars in the train crew and five volunteers like Calendar. It was around this somber young man that the others gathered, for when he unlimbered his guitar and started singing, everyone listened.    He had a reedy voice that spoke of western campfires, and he knew all the songs the old-time cowboys had sung—“Aura Lee,” “Buffalo Gal,” “Old Blue,” “Old Paint”—and the two new songs which were so popular on the radio, “The Last Roundup” and “Wagon Wheels.” But the songs that captivated the men were two that scarcely seemed to be songs at all; they were fragments of human experience, deep and moving. 
MichJC.txt	1524	1500.0	1974	Michener, James A	Centennial	  “I know a place in Chicago, they might give it on credit,” Gregg said. “In art you’ve got to give yourself every advantage.”    The train braked to a halt and voices outside the caboose shouted, “This goddamn train is infested with hobos.” And the crew piled out with baseball bats and started knocking drifters from beneath the cars, and Gregg looked out the window and saw one man run past with blood streaming down his face, and for a moment the running man looked up in an appeal for help, but Gregg was powerless.    When the train resumed its trek eastward he could not eat. The four crewmen who ran the caboose were not evil men, but when they had gone after the hobos they had swung their bats with actual glee, as if knocking helpless men over the head were sport. It was sickening.    Calendar was the only one who understood what had happened to Gregg, and he went to him with half a sandwich, but the professor still could not eat. “What’s the matter?” Cisco asked. “You never see a man clubbed before?” He took Gregg’s hand and passed it over his head so the professor could feel the knobs.    “These are hateful times,” Gregg said.    “We’ve had worse,” Calendar replied, and he resumed singing.    In the thirty-fourth hour the train pulled into the stockyards, and Dr. Gregg for the first time saw for himself just how hateful the times really were, for when the Venneford Herefords were unloaded and auctioned next day, he found that the handsome animals fetched only $13.87 each.

She poured him a cup of coffee and said gently, “I wonder if I dare take the sign down before the children see it?”    “No,” he said firmly. “It’s the law. We owe the money and there’s no way out.”    “How can a nation support a law which takes away a man’s farm? Especially when it’s the nation that’s gone wrong, not us?”    “The bank has to be paid.”    “But it’s the banks that refuse to circulate their money.” She was not argumentative, merely bewildered by this savage turn.    When the children came home and saw the notice they started to cry, and she felt it her responsibility to shield them from as much pain as possible. “We’ll live somewhere else,” she said brightly as she prepared toast and cocoa. From the bare shelf she took down her last jar of jam and they had a mournful picnic, after which she suggested that they all walk down to the Volkemas’ to discuss what must be done.    “Put on your scarfs,” she said. “We don’t want to freeze.” At this unfortunate word, Victoria remembered Ethan and started to cry, but her mother caught her by the hand and said, “Now, Vicky. Watch the children and we’ll go across the fields.” But as they went past the barn Timmy broke away and ran to where Rodeo was fattening and he flung his arms about the handsome Hereford and stayed there till his mother dragged him away. 
MichJC.txt	1701	120.0	1974	Michener, James A	Centennial	    On Thursday, November 29, we drove to the spot which Garrett loved most in America, the one he visited at least twice each year. It was of little consequence, really, and even though it had at one point played a specific role in American history, it had not been a major one; few Americans could ever have heard of it. But the site had been preserved with such intelligence that it stood as an example of almost flawless restoration.    It was Fort Laramie, still standing in silence at the spot where the swift dark Laramie River emptied into the North Platte. Wild turkeys still roamed the fields where the Indians had camped during the Treaty of 1851, and elk could sometimes be seen on the range where the Oglala Sioux had hunted. In the soft limestone west of the fort the deep ruts of wagon wheels could still be seen, where straining forty-niners had dragged their covered wagons.    The old buildings had been preserved if their walls were sound, or reconstructed if only their foundations remained, and not a false note had been struck. There were no mighty cannon or ramparts filled with dummy soldiers firing at nonexistent Indians. Only the materials available in the 1860s and 1870s had been used, and the sutler’s store where the emigrants had bought their last food before heading west for Oregon still offered Arbuckle’s coffee and those handsome white blankets of the Hudson’s Bay Company.

Then, pulling away, she looked at him admiringly. ‘You’ve done wonderful things with your life, Mr. Minister.’    ‘The name is Szymon,’ he said. ‘The name was always Szymon.’    ‘You were just a boy when I first knew you,’ she said.    ‘Think of it,’ he said to the younger Buks as he took a chair at the kitchen table. ‘At seventeen I was in that forest … head of a commando … had already killed my first Nazi … the one who had hanged my grandmother.’    He liked what he saw of young Pani Buk: Kazimiera was of that stalwart breed which had always kept the farms of Poland, Lithuania, Ukraine and Russia functioning. She was prepared to serve as wife, mother, cook, seamstress, ox when the plow had to be pulled, and always as the sharp verbal critic. It was to her that he now spoke, as if acknowledging that inside the cottage she was mistress.

We can’t buy anything with them.’    ‘But I’d leave them anyway. To demonstrate my good will.’    ‘Good will we know you have. I knew your mother, I knew your grandmother. And women like that do not produce poor sons.’    They talked for a while of the old days, and tough Biruta began to weep when she recalled that special night when Bukowski had come to this cottage to talk her and her husband into joining his underground unit, then operating out of the Forest of Szczek. ‘They were heroic days,’ she said.    ‘These are heroic days, Biruta.’    ‘How have you managed to mess up this country so abominably?’    ‘We’re not free in Warsaw, you know.’ And that was all he would concede. ‘You will let me have some food?’    ‘Of course. You came here before, begging for food, and we gave it then, didn’t we?’    ‘What can I give you in return?’    ‘Not zlotys. Szymon, zlotys are no longer worth a damn. But we would like some books about farming … for Janko and our young ones.’    ‘Books you shall have,’ he said. Then he left the cottage and whistled for the driver to bring the government car closer so that its trunk could be packed with items of food no longer obtainable in Warsaw.           
TwaiMTS.txt	0	2.0	1876	Twain, Mark	The Adventures of Tom Sawyer	CHAPTER I    "TOM!"    No answer.    "TOM!"    No answer.    "What's gone with that boy, I wonder? You TOM!"    No answer.    The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the  room; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or  never looked _through_ them for so small a thing as a boy; they were  her state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for "style," not  service--she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well.  She looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but  still loud enough for the furniture to hear:    "Well, I lay if I get hold of you I'll--"    She did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching  under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the  punches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat.    "I never did see the beat of that boy!"    She went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the  tomato vines and "jimpson" weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom. So  she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted:    "Y-o-u-u TOM!"    There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize  a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight. 
TwaiMTS.txt	1	2.0	1876	Twain, Mark	The Adventures of Tom Sawyer	  "There! I might 'a' thought of that closet. What you been doing in  there?"    "Nothing."    "Nothing! Look at your hands. And look at your mouth. What _is_ that  truck?"    "I don't know, aunt."    "Well, I know. It's jam--that's what it is. Forty times I've said if you  didn't let that jam alone I'd skin you. Hand me that switch."    The switch hovered in the air--the peril was desperate--    "My! Look behind you, aunt!"    The old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of danger.  The lad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and  disappeared over it.    His aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentle  laugh.    "Hang the boy, can't I never learn anything? Ain't he played me tricks  enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time? But old  fools is the biggest fools there is. Can't learn an old dog new tricks,  as the saying is. But my goodness, he never plays them alike, two days,  and how is a body to know what's coming? He 'pears to know just how long  he can torment me before I get my dander up, and he knows if he can make  out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh, it's all down again and  I can't hit him a lick. I ain't doing my duty by that boy, and that's  the Lord's truth, goodness knows.
TwaiMTS.txt	4	3.0	1876	Twain, Mark	The Adventures of Tom Sawyer	  The trouble vanished out of Tom's face. He opened his jacket. His shirt  collar was securely sewed.    "Bother! Well, go 'long with you. I'd made sure you'd played hookey  and been a-swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon you're a kind of a  singed cat, as the saying is--better'n you look. _This_ time."    She was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad that Tom  had stumbled into obedient conduct for once.    But Sidney said:    "Well, now, if I didn't think you sewed his collar with white thread,  but it's black."    "Why, I did sew it with white! Tom!"    But Tom did not wait for the rest. As he went out at the door he said:    "Siddy, I'll lick you for that."    In a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into  the lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them--one needle  carried white thread and the other black. He said:    "She'd never noticed if it hadn't been for Sid. Confound it! sometimes  she sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with black. I wish to  gee-miny she'd stick to one or t'other--I can't keep the run of 'em. But  I bet you I'll lam Sid for that. I'll learn him!"    He was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the model boy very well  though--and loathed him. 
TwaiMTS.txt	44	30.0	1876	Twain, Mark	The Adventures of Tom Sawyer	In the midst of the prayer a fly had  lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by  calmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its head with its arms, and  polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with  the body, and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view; scraping  its wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they  had been coat-tails; going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if  it knew it was perfectly safe. As indeed it was; for as sorely as Tom's  hands itched to grab for it they did not dare--he believed his soul would  be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going  on. But with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal  forward; and the instant the "Amen" was out the fly was a prisoner of  war. His aunt detected the act and made him let it go.    The minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an  argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod--and  yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and  thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly  worth the saving. Tom counted the pages of the sermon; after church he  always knew how many pages there had been, but he seldom knew anything  else about the discourse.
TwaiMTS.txt	63	30.0	1876	Twain, Mark	The Adventures of Tom Sawyer	        CHAPTER VII    THE harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book, the more his ideas  wandered. So at last, with a sigh and a yawn, he gave it up. It seemed  to him that the noon recess would never come. The air was utterly dead.  There was not a breath stirring. It was the sleepiest of sleepy days.  The drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed  the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees. Away off in the  flaming sunshine, Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green sides through a  shimmering veil of heat, tinted with the purple of distance; a few birds  floated on lazy wing high in the air; no other living thing was visible  but some cows, and they were asleep. Tom's heart ached to be free, or  else to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time.  His hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of  gratitude that was prayer, though he did not know it. Then furtively  the percussion-cap box came out. He released the tick and put him on  the long flat desk. The creature probably glowed with a gratitude that  amounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was premature: for when  he started thankfully to travel off, Tom turned him aside with a pin and  made him take a new direction. 
TwaiMTS.txt	84	7.0	1876	Twain, Mark	The Adventures of Tom Sawyer	  Presently, when the moon emerged again, Injun Joe was standing over the  two forms, contemplating them. The doctor murmured inarticulately, gave  a long gasp or two and was still. The half-breed muttered:    "_That_ score is settled--damn you."    Then he robbed the body. After which he put the fatal knife in Potter's  open right hand, and sat down on the dismantled coffin. Three--four--five  minutes passed, and then Potter began to stir and moan. His hand closed  upon the knife; he raised it, glanced at it, and let it fall, with a  shudder. Then he sat up, pushing the body from him, and gazed at it, and  then around him, confusedly. His eyes met Joe's.    "Lord, how is this, Joe?" he said.    "It's a dirty business," said Joe, without moving.    "What did you do it for?"    "I! I never done it!"    "Look here! That kind of talk won't wash."    Potter trembled and grew white.    "I thought I'd got sober. I'd no business to drink to-night. But it's  in my head yet--worse'n when we started here. I'm all in a muddle;  can't recollect anything of it, hardly. Tell me, Joe--_honest_, now,  old feller--did I do it? Joe, I never meant to--'pon my soul and honor, I  never meant to, Joe. Tell me how it was, Joe. Oh, it's awful--and him so  young and promising." 
TwaiMTS.txt	91	1.5	1876	Twain, Mark	The Adventures of Tom Sawyer	  "_You_ bad!" and Huckleberry began to snuffle too. "Consound it, Tom  Sawyer, you're just old pie, 'long-side o' what I am. Oh, _lordy_,  lordy, lordy, I wisht I only had half your chance."    Tom choked off and whispered:    "Look, Hucky, look! He's got his _back_ to us!"    Hucky looked, with joy in his heart.    "Well, he has, by jingoes! Did he before?"    "Yes, he did. But I, like a fool, never thought. Oh, this is bully, you  know. _Now_ who can he mean?"    The howling stopped. Tom pricked up his ears.    "Sh! What's that?" he whispered.    "Sounds like--like hogs grunting. No--it's somebody snoring, Tom."    "That _is_ it! Where 'bouts is it, Huck?"    "I bleeve it's down at 'tother end. Sounds so, anyway. Pap used to sleep  there, sometimes, 'long with the hogs, but laws bless you, he just lifts  things when _he_ snores. Besides, I reckon he ain't ever coming back to  this town any more."    The spirit of adventure rose in the boys' souls once more.    "Hucky, do you das't to go if I lead?"    "I don't like to, much. Tom, s'pose it's Injun Joe!" 
TwaiMTS.txt	131	60.0	1876	Twain, Mark	The Adventures of Tom Sawyer	  Aunt Polly knelt down and prayed for Tom so touchingly, so appealingly,  and with such measureless love in her words and her old trembling voice,  that he was weltering in tears again, long before she was through.    He had to keep still long after she went to bed, for she kept making  broken-hearted ejaculations from time to time, tossing unrestfully, and  turning over. But at last she was still, only moaning a little in her  sleep. Now the boy stole out, rose gradually by the bedside, shaded the  candle-light with his hand, and stood regarding her. His heart was full  of pity for her. He took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the  candle. But something occurred to him, and he lingered considering.  His face lighted with a happy solution of his thought; he put the bark  hastily in his pocket. Then he bent over and kissed the faded lips, and  straightway made his stealthy exit, latching the door behind him.    He threaded his way back to the ferry landing, found nobody at large  there, and walked boldly on board the boat, for he knew she was  tenantless except that there was a watchman, who always turned in and  slept like a graven image. He untied the skiff at the stern, slipped  into it, and was soon rowing cautiously upstream. When he had pulled a  mile above the village, he started quartering across and bent himself  stoutly to his work. He hit the landing on the other side neatly, for  this was a familiar bit of work to him. He was moved to capture  the skiff, arguing that it might be considered a ship and therefore  legitimate prey for a pirate, but he knew a thorough search would be  made for it and that might end in revelations. So he stepped ashore and  entered the woods. 
TwaiMTS.txt	133	120.0	1876	Twain, Mark	The Adventures of Tom Sawyer	They went about poking sticks into the sand, and when they found a soft  place they went down on their knees and dug with their hands. Sometimes  they would take fifty or sixty eggs out of one hole. They were perfectly  round white things a trifle smaller than an English walnut. They had a  famous fried-egg feast that night, and another on Friday morning.    After breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar, and  chased each other round and round, shedding clothes as they went, until  they were naked, and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal  water of the bar, against the stiff current, which latter tripped their  legs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun.  And now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each  other's faces with their palms, gradually approaching each other, with  averted faces to avoid the strangling sprays, and finally gripping and  struggling till the best man ducked his neighbor, and then they all  went under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing,  sputtering, laughing, and gasping for breath at one and the same time.    When they were well exhausted, they would run out and sprawl on the dry,  hot sand, and lie there and cover themselves up with it, and by and by  break for the water again and go through the original performance once  more. Finally it occurred to them that their naked skin represented  flesh-colored "tights" very fairly; so they drew a ring in the sand and  had a circus--with three clowns in it, for none would yield this proudest  post to his neighbor. 
TwaiMTS.txt	173	7200.0	1876	Twain, Mark	The Adventures of Tom Sawyer	They swore in the signpainter's boy, told him the scheme, and asked his  help. He had his own reasons for being delighted, for the master boarded  in his father's family and had given the boy ample cause to hate him.  The master's wife would go on a visit to the country in a few days, and  there would be nothing to interfere with the plan; the master always  prepared himself for great occasions by getting pretty well fuddled, and  the signpainter's boy said that when the dominie had reached the proper  condition on Examination Evening he would "manage the thing" while he  napped in his chair; then he would have him awakened at the right time  and hurried away to school.    In the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived. At eight in  the evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted, and adorned with  wreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers. The master sat throned in  his great chair upon a raised platform, with his blackboard behind him.  He was looking tolerably mellow. Three rows of benches on each side and  six rows in front of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town  and by the parents of the pupils. To his left, back of the rows of  citizens, was a spacious temporary platform upon which were seated the  scholars who were to take part in the exercises of the evening; rows of  small boys, washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort;  rows of gawky big boys; snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in  lawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms, their  grandmothers' ancient trinkets, their bits of pink and blue ribbon and  the flowers in their hair. All the rest of the house was filled with  non-participating scholars. 
TwaiMTS.txt	175	60.0	1876	Twain, Mark	The Adventures of Tom Sawyer	by the young ladies. Each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of the  platform, cleared her throat, held up her manuscript (tied with dainty  ribbon), and proceeded to read, with labored attention to "expression"  and punctuation. The themes were the same that had been illuminated upon  similar occasions by their mothers before them, their grandmothers,  and doubtless all their ancestors in the female line clear back to the  Crusades. "Friendship" was one; "Memories of Other Days"; "Religion in  History"; "Dream Land"; "The Advantages of Culture"; "Forms of Political  Government Compared and Contrasted"; "Melancholy"; "Filial Love"; "Heart  Longings," etc., etc.    A prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted  melancholy; another was a wasteful and opulent gush of "fine language";  another was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words  and phrases until they were worn entirely out; and a peculiarity that  conspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable  sermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one  of them. No matter what the subject might be, a brainracking effort was  made to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and religious  mind could contemplate with edification. The glaring insincerity of  these sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the  fashion from the schools, and it is not sufficient today; it never will  be sufficient while the world stands, perhaps. There is no school in  all our land where the young ladies do not feel obliged to close their  compositions with a sermon; and you will find that the sermon of the  most frivolous and the least religious girl in the school is always  the longest and the most relentlessly pious. But enough of this. Homely  truth is unpalatable. 
TwaiMTS.txt	224	240.0	1876	Twain, Mark	The Adventures of Tom Sawyer	  The procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters of  a mile, and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch  avenues, fly along the dismal corridors, and take each other by surprise  at points where the corridors joined again. Parties were able to elude  each other for the space of half an hour without going beyond the  "known" ground.    By-and-by, one group after another came straggling back to the mouth  of the cave, panting, hilarious, smeared from head to foot with tallow  drippings, daubed with clay, and entirely delighted with the success of  the day. Then they were astonished to find that they had been taking  no note of time and that night was about at hand. The clanging bell had  been calling for half an hour. However, this sort of close to the day's  adventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory. When the ferryboat  with her wild freight pushed into the stream, nobody cared sixpence for  the wasted time but the captain of the craft.    Huck was already upon his watch when the ferryboat's lights went  glinting past the wharf. He heard no noise on board, for the young  people were as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly  tired to death. He wondered what boat it was, and why she did not  stop at the wharf--and then he dropped her out of his mind and put his  attention upon his business. The night was growing cloudy and dark. Ten  o'clock came, and the noise of vehicles ceased, scattered lights began  to wink out, all straggling foot-passengers disappeared, the village  betook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the  silence and the ghosts. Eleven o'clock came, and the tavern lights were  put out; darkness everywhere, now. Huck waited what seemed a weary long  time, but nothing happened. His faith was weakening. Was there any use? 
TwaiMTS.txt	231	2.5	1876	Twain, Mark	The Adventures of Tom Sawyer	  "Now, my boy, I hope you're good and hungry, because breakfast will be  ready as soon as the sun's up, and we'll have a piping hot one, too--make  yourself easy about that! I and the boys hoped you'd turn up and stop  here last night."    "I was awful scared," said Huck, "and I run. I took out when the pistols  went off, and I didn't stop for three mile. I've come now becuz I wanted  to know about it, you know; and I come before daylight becuz I didn't  want to run across them devils, even if they was dead."    "Well, poor chap, you do look as if you'd had a hard night of it--but  there's a bed here for you when you've had your breakfast. No, they  ain't dead, lad--we are sorry enough for that. You see we knew right  where to put our hands on them, by your description; so we crept along  on tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of them--dark as a cellar that  sumach path was--and just then I found I was going to sneeze. It was the  meanest kind of luck! I tried to keep it back, but no use--'twas bound to  come, and it did come! I was in the lead with my pistol raised, and when  the sneeze started those scoundrels a-rustling to get out of the path,  I sung out, 'Fire boys!' and blazed away at the place where the rustling  was. So did the boys. But they were off in a jiffy, those villains, and  we after them, down through the woods. I judge we never touched them. 
TwaiMTS.txt	264	1.5	1876	Twain, Mark	The Adventures of Tom Sawyer	  "Huck, we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the  world."    "Good as wheat! What makes you think the money's--"    "Huck, you just wait till we get in there. If we don't find it I'll  agree to give you my drum and every thing I've got in the world. I will,  by jings."    "All right--it's a whiz. When do you say?"    "Right now, if you say it. Are you strong enough?"    "Is it far in the cave? I ben on my pins a little, three or four days,  now, but I can't walk more'n a mile, Tom--least I don't think I could."    "It's about five mile into there the way anybody but me would go, Huck,  but there's a mighty short cut that they don't anybody but me know  about. Huck, I'll take you right to it in a skiff. I'll float the skiff  down there, and I'll pull it back again all by myself. You needn't ever  turn your hand over."    "Less start right off, Tom."    "All right. We want some bread and meat, and our pipes, and a little  bag or two, and two or three kite-strings, and some of these new-fangled  things they call lucifer matches. I tell you, many's the time I wished I  had some when I was in there before." 
TwaiMTS.txt	282	2.0	1876	Twain, Mark	The Adventures of Tom Sawyer	  "Huck, I wouldn't want to, and I _don't_ want to--but what would people  say? Why, they'd say, 'Mph! Tom Sawyer's Gang! pretty low characters in  it!' They'd mean you, Huck. You wouldn't like that, and I wouldn't."    Huck was silent for some time, engaged in a mental struggle. Finally he  said:    "Well, I'll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and see if I  can come to stand it, if you'll let me b'long to the gang, Tom."    "All right, Huck, it's a whiz! Come along, old chap, and I'll ask the  widow to let up on you a little, Huck."    "Will you, Tom--now will you? That's good. If she'll let up on some of  the roughest things, I'll smoke private and cuss private, and crowd  through or bust. When you going to start the gang and turn robbers?"    "Oh, right off. We'll get the boys together and have the initiation  tonight, maybe."    "Have the which?"    "Have the initiation."    "What's that?"    "It's to swear to stand by one another, and never tell the gang's  secrets, even if you're chopped all to flinders, and kill anybody and  all his family that hurts one of the gang."    "That's gay--that's mighty gay, Tom, I tell you."    "Well, I bet it is. And all that swearing's got to be done at midnight,  in the lonesomest, awfulest place you can find--a ha'nted house is the  best, but they're all ripped up now." 
TwaiMTS.txt	283	1.0	1876	Twain, Mark	The Adventures of Tom Sawyer	  "Well, midnight's good, anyway, Tom."    "Yes, so it is. And you've got to swear on a coffin, and sign it with  blood."    "Now, that's something _like_! Why, it's a million times bullier than  pirating. I'll stick to the widder till I rot, Tom; and if I git to be  a reg'lar ripper of a robber, and everybody talking 'bout it, I reckon  she'll be proud she snaked me in out of the wet."    CONCLUSION    SO endeth this chronicle. It being strictly a history of a _boy_, it  must stop here; the story could not go much further without becoming the  history of a _man_. When one writes a novel about grown people, he knows  exactly where to stop--that is, with a marriage; but when he writes of  juveniles, he must stop where he best can.    Most of the characters that perform in this book still live, and are  prosperous and happy. Some day it may seem worth while to take up the  story of the younger ones again and see what sort of men and women they  turned out to be; therefore it will be wisest not to reveal any of that  part of their lives at present.     
DibdCHH.txt	0	5256000.0	1792	Dibdin, Charles, 1745-1814	HANNAH HEWIT	    TO THE PUBLIC.  THE Readers of Hannah Hewit, having been requested to suppose that her life was written by herself, are now entreated to go on and suppose a little more; and first, that her brother, Captain Higgins, to whom Hewit's chest was given in care, was shipwrecked and lost, in his passage home, on one of the Scilly Islands; and that the cargo and different effects of the Dane, and of course Hewit's chest, fell a prey to the fishermen, smugglers, and other uncivilized boors who inhabit those islands.  Let me then intrude for a further supposition that Hewit's chest, having been thrown among some lumber in a cellar, was discovered, eight years afterwards, by a Grub-street Poet; who, tired out by a long series of literary disappointments, turned misanthrope, and went to reside in that obscure part of the world.  This supposed, permit me to make interest for one more supposition, that by some circuitous route, no matter what, the whole of these materials came into my possession; that I found them a large, loose, indigested    mass; that I seperated, methodized, and regulated them, and that they are now given to the public in that form which I thought would be most acceptable.  These suppositions, let me tell the reader, are not amiss: First, if Captain Higgins, notwithstanding his boasted security and implicit reliance on the wind, was cast away, what cause would there be to admire the prescience of Hannah Hewit, who warned him against taking the voyage, and actually prevailed on seven other persons to stay with her, thereby saving their lives. 
DibdCHH.txt	1	0	1792	Dibdin, Charles, 1745-1814	HANNAH HEWIT	Next, the supposition that Hewit's chest, filled with manuscripts, should be thrown about like lumber among a set of people who could not read, is really neat enough; and, again, it is not only ingenious to say an author should be the first to rescue them from oblivion, but it is fairly in point, being poor, that he should wish to get something by them. The only wonder is, that he did not pass them for his own; except, indeed, we believe that they are his invention, and that, as lady writing is now very fashionable, he thought it his interest to foist them upon Hannah, but this last will not do, for it knocks up the other suppositions.  The last supposition, that this work, by some means or other, came into my hands, is not to be so easily cleared;    for, account for it how I may, it is impossible that I should every where gain credit. My readers, therefore, for I hope there will be a great many, and I am sure they will all be candid and kind, having so handsomely indulged me with several suppositions for my accommodation, are respectfully requested, on this subject, to add a supposition for themselves. 
DibdCHH.txt	24	5256000.0	1792	Dibdin, Charles, 1745-1814	HANNAH HEWIT	THE variety of occupations followed at Wolverhampton, coming in contact with a mind thirsting after improvement, and fertile in invention, like mine, no wonder if my progress, as an artist and a mechanic, was remarkable. No ingenious device, elegant form, or tasty invention, was put into hand 'till I was consulted. At length my judgment and opinion became so celebrated, that, before I was fifteen, my abilities were considered as equal to a fortune, and I might have made my choice among the most opulent at Wolverhampton.    Destiny, however, which all must obey, an observation that never was more truly verified than in my wayward fortune, ordained otherwise. John Hewit, though a man of indifferent character, bad connections, low conversation, and only an appretice to a tinman; why, or wherefore, I did not know, won my heart in spight of me; and, for him, I rejected with disdain the most eligible offers.  Were I to avail myself of my privilege as a writer, I might defend my conduct upon various principles; but, as I am writing a life, and not a controversy, I shall only speak of myself as a woman, and say that, though my conduct was madness, I could not have courage to argue with the impulse I felt; and, therefore, yielded to what I knew would make me miserable. 
DibdCHH.txt	46	10080.0	1792	Dibdin, Charles, 1745-1814	HANNAH HEWIT	Whenever I can spare time, she is upon my knee, and then, by way of mortifying the jezabels, who would have let her die without help, I make them turn out watch, and watch to nurse her. But, Hannah, you are to understand these are not English women, they are a sort of Spanish mulattos. No, no, I have seen a pretty many countries, but either for beauty, or goodness, there are no women in the world like the English. The mother of my little    charge was an American. Her features are very beautiful; and so after a bit of a snivel, for you know I am a woman in these matters, I had her treated with all decency, and then committed her to Davy Jones's locker; and for want of a chaplain, I said the burial service myself, and, perhaps, with as much sincerity, as his reverence. And so you see the love I was in such a cursed hurry to entertain for the dingy ladies, I transferred to the mother of my little smiling companion. You don't know what good company she is, though she can't speak; but that you know she'll pay off with interest when she grows up. I ll make her fortune if I live. But don't you think I have made a good distinction? No, no; that is my pride; a true sailor never thinksof skin deep pleasures whenever any thing comes across him that interests the heart. 
DibdCHH.txt	47	20160.0	1792	Dibdin, Charles, 1745-1814	HANNAH HEWIT	But I must be brief, as the Ghost says in Hamlet, 'The prize is going to leave    us.' I have put on board the second lieutenant, as prize-master, Jack Ringbolt, Dick Dawson, Joe Musgrove, and the cleverest fellow, of an ordinary seaman, I ever met with, one Charles Walmsley, I entered him myself at Bristol, he is a devilish sightly sellow, and sings a good song, but what's better, as we boarded the St. Domingo man, he sent a Spanish rascal to Abraham's bosom just as he was aiming a a pole ax at my head.  Now after all, I'll tell you what, I am almost sorry for what has been done; the captain is sulky, and won't avail himself of of our good fortune. He has taken the command of the ship again, and ordered us to go for Bristol, where, he says, he'll bring us to account. Lord love him, I know him to be as good a man as ever lived, and as clever a seaman as ever stept between stem and stern; a valuable friend, an affectionate husband, and a tender father; but I have ruined him for all that,    by disobeying his orders, and yet his orders were reasonable. 'Tis true he'll convince his owners that we were guilty of mutiny, but will he convince them, that this St. Domingo man, is not worth five and fifty thousand pounds? But I hope to reconcile him before we arrive; in which case he shall freely have all the glory of the battle, and I'll content myself with having saved little Britannia from a watery grave. In either case, I know, you love me well enough to give me your approbation. Adieu, the first box of indigo we unpack I'll send you as a present to blue your cloaths, being,  Dear Hannah, Your affectionate brother, THOMAS HIGGINS.

To get rid, therefore, of every ill consequence that might arise from her discovering him, he connived at a prosecution against himself for a perjury, before she could be ripe for any such attack, and thus, by properly preparing the evidence, he avoided all possible danger, because no man can be tried for the same offence a second time.  Of this crime every one believed him guilty; but since the law did not find him so, mere opinions were to him of very little consequence. In Newgate he was visited by people of fashion; when he was acquitted, a hired rabble gave a shout of applause, and he spent that evening at one of the first gaming houses in town, and though he was kicked out for want of money, he returned in a short    time with his pockets well lined, and, afterwards reigned master of a Pharoah Bank, from whence he used to say, he had seen men rise nabobs at night who had been beggars in the morning, and others beggars who in the morning had been nabobs.        CHAP. VII. TWO ATTEMPTS AT A RAPE UPON POOR HANNAH, ONE BY SOURBY, AND THE OTHER BY NOBODY KNOWS WHO, TOGETHER WITH THE HEROISM OF BINNS, AND THE ARRIVAL OF A STRANGER. 
DibdCHH.txt	60	180.0	1792	Dibdin, Charles, 1745-1814	HANNAH HEWIT	There was something so ingenuous in this confession, that, without hesitation, I agreed that he should be my guide home, for, after all, there was some work to be given out early in the morning, which nobody could fit but myself, and, however, satisfied I might be as to Mr. Smallbrook's considerateness, I made it a rule never to neglect his business, unless upon any pressing occasion; as this would have been,    had it not been cleared up, in which case he would have blamed me for standing upon so much ceremony.  As to Binns, I own, I never was so astonished in my life as at what I had heard, but I did not suppose, singular as his conduct was, I had any thing to appre hend from it, because he had always appeared to me to be a man of strict honour; besides I was well guarded, and I felt a peculiar impulse, which never in my life has deceived me, that I should come to no harm.  It was uncommonly dark, and if my guide had not been furnished with a lantern by Mrs. Crow, we should scarcely been able to sind our way. For a good distance we went on pretty well, but there was something, at last, in the business I did not like. The fellow was every minute crying out hush, don't you hear a noise? And this when there was no cause    for apprehension; and, therefore, it must have been to frighten me, By and bye, when we came exactly to that part of Love-lane, where Jenny Rhodes stabbed Susan Wingrove, he cried out 'Lord have mercy upon us,' fell down, and extinguished the light. 
DibdCHH.txt	276	1440.0	1792	Dibdin, Charles, 1745-1814	HANNAH HEWIT	Almost the whole day had I been in this anxious, distressing state, with nothing to offer towards the succour of these poor shipwrecked wretches but my prayers, when the storm came on to rage with a degree of violence more dreadful than ever, accompanied with torrents of rain, sheets of vivid lightning, and peals of terrifying thunder. Indeed soon did I witness the difference between the ineffectual    thunder invented by man, and that which speaks the Deity; for if the poor ship's signal of distress alarmed me in the morning, so transcendantly awful was what I now heard, that nothing but an implicit trust in him, in whom we live and move, and have our being, weak and ill as I was, could have preserved my reason, or, perhaps, my life.  Indeed I could not venture within the cavern, drenched as I was in rain, and weak for want of food, till the thunder had gone by, for there I knew the effect must be much stronger. The thunder ceased, but the storm continued with equal, if not encreased violence, and the tide setting in, the sprays, beat in such volumes against the rock that they seemed to threaten its very summit. 
DibdCHH.txt	283	20.0	1792	Dibdin, Charles, 1745-1814	HANNAH HEWIT	When I arrived at the opening in the rock I could plainly perceive that the object which obstructed the light was a part of some ship; and presently afterwards I crept into her without difficulty through    one of her ports. I next got up the forecastle, and there perceived, by her form, that she could be no other than the vessel I had seen ashore, but how she could have come into that situation, jammed into a cleft of a rock, I could not for the life of me imagine.  Examining, however, around, I concluded, that as the tide set in, the violence of the tempest had brought the ship along with it, and by the influence of a tornado had thrown her into that situation; where the storm having abated, she was safe from danger as in a dry dock; and putting circumstances together, I found nothing extraordinary in this, for in the year 1778, or thereabouts, the hurricanes in the West-Indies, did actually tear vessels from their moorings and thrown them into the towns. One instance of which happened at Fort Royal, in Jamaica, and another at St. Kitts.    If I was ungrateful enough to murmur at my former disappointment, how did I take shame to myself at the present moment. To see succour, comfort, convenience, nay, even luxury, brought, as it were, to my very door! Oh how my grateful heart ran over! I almost gloried in my strong trials, convinced that I was still the care of Providence, whose inscrutable decrees, however weak sighted mortals may dare to dispute them, permit not a fly to perish in vain. 
DibdCHH.txt	284	120.0	1792	Dibdin, Charles, 1745-1814	HANNAH HEWIT	When my mind became a little more calm, I determined to examine the ship. By her size she must have been of seven or eight hundred tons burthen, she was coppered bottomed, and wore, in every respect, the appearance of an Indiaman; and by her lading, I soon found she was homeward bound. In examining her more particularly, I discovered that a large part of her cargo yet remained on board, some of which had been materially damaged in    consequence of her having filled with water, though she was perfectly dry at this time, the water having ran out again through her leaks.  And now a dreadful spectacle presented itself to my view. Five dead bodies lay between decks in a most lacerated state; a little further, three more; and at the door of a cabin, which I found afterwards to be the purser's, a man and woman of genteel appearance, were locked in each other's arms. I sustained all this misery with the best fortitude I could, determined, before I considered the living, to pay every due respect I could to the dead.  Among these poor wretches were three women and seven men. I searched their pockets with a view to learn who they were, but in this my expectation failed, except in four instances. The gentleman and lady I found in each other's arms, were    Mons. and Madame D'Oliviere, a young man, well dressed, was called D'Aubignac, and a woman, apparently an attendant, was named Jeannotte Du Bois. 
DibdCHH.txt	342	20160.0	1792	Dibdin, Charles, 1745-1814	HANNAH HEWIT	I had found aboard the Entrepreneur, as before noticed, a great variety of colours for painting; but, besides this, I had now made from earth, bones, flowers, the blood of the sea snake, and other materials,    some admirable colours of my own. Oils, and varnishes, I had brought to such perfection, that I had no doubt but in time I should rival the famous varnish in which the beautiful tone of the cremona fiddle is said to consist.  Thus I was completely stocked with materials for painting. As for music, I had a harp, a guitar, a mandolina, two fiddles, several flutes, and a viol di gamba, besides a very large assortment of strings, both in catgut and wire, and, as I was determined to make a piano-forte for my saloon, I had no doubt in the end of fitting up an organ in my chapel.  As for writing, I had a long time abandoned the plantain leaf, being well supplied with pen, ink, and paper; and thus I was now prepared to write my history, to paint it, and to set it to music, and all this I was determined in some    degree to perform even, as I have repeatedly said, though time should bury me and my labours in the same oblivion.

I broke her heart by my infamous suspicions, who was as immaculate as innocence; drove her to penury and want, and then this inoffensive little one, the victim of my folly, became a prey to poverty and disease.'  "No, no," said Greenhead, "that never would have been the case while it had a mother who was one of the most ingenius and industrious woman that ever existed." 'Add, said I, the most amiable, and the most wronged.' "I am afraid so," answered he, "for though    her delicacy and prudence prevented her from complaining, it was evident she had a husband who little deserved so much virtue and goodness. But, Mr. Walmesley, said he, I had no idea, when I took you by the hand as an old friend, who I had known to possess all the manly honour of a true tar, that I should be obliged to upbraid you with having, under the feigned name of Hewit, betrayed and abandoned a woman that would have done honour to the first abilities and the first distinction.

So being a devil of a fellow at promise, he found me when he came back exactly in the same place where he left me, stuck as fast as if I had been one of the twelve Caesar's done by a sealcutter. I found him exactly the same creature; smoked as many sagars, drank as much grog, cracked as many jokes, and did as many good natured things as ever.  'Away we went to work, sold our ship and cargo, sacked the rupees, and prepared all matters for our return to the    land of beef and pudding. Every thing now appeared as if it was coming to a climax; we seemed as if we were all to meet together like players at the end of the last act. One morning as captain Higgins and I were going along, we met captain Higgins ' "Why what a stupid fellow you are, said my brother, how could I meet myself? You mean Hewit."

I have heard Mr. Williams, when I believed her to have been my mother, speak of her in terms of the highest praise, and well he might, if she bore the slightest resemblance to her daughter, whose virtues, when I thought her my sister, were ever the objects of my admiration, and since she has been my wife, now eighteen years, they have manifested themselves in so many tender and attentive instances of affectionate kindness, which Heaven knows, have been rigourously put to the test, that I must be, which I hope is not in my nature, most dishonourable and ungrateful, if I did not, through life, make her happiness my study.  'You have heard, that in the year 1743,    there was an explosion in a coal mine, this unfortunate woman, with several other persons, and particularly a brother of yours called Peter, were killed; but this was not the fact, for it was my wife's brother that was killed, and not yours, I am your brother, and the extraordinary circumstance of my being brought up as the son of Binns, arose from nothing more than that having lost his son, and knowing that the countenance and support of his sister would wholly depend on the chance of her having a male heir to keep up her name, he stole me, who happened to be on the spot, though unhurt, carried me home, passed me for his son, which deceit my age and complexion favoured, and thus accomplished his designs against the purse of his sister.

If the vice I had painted appeared ugly, and the virtue beautiful, it was all I had a right to expect; that done, men must think for themselves. There is no telling mankind, said I, how to be right, nor how to be happy, that knowledge is born with us, and we feel insulted at hearing an explanation of what we already know. But it is not simply to be happy, it is to be happy by rule, by mode, by taste; thus pleasure leads to folly, folly to vice, and vice to misfortune, yet nothing is so easy as to avoid the evil and chuse the good, but it all arises from the perverseness of human nature; and if Jupiter's tubs were promiscuously presented to mortals for sale,    I know not whether the plagues would not turn out more marketable than the pleasures.  But my history is arrived at the very moment in which I am writing; I must, therefore, arrange it, and deposit it, with every necessary document, in Hewit's chest, that my brother may have every possible proof, on his publishing it, that all the particulars it contains are true and genuine.

The ship will then be underweigh, Heaven send that it may arriver at its destined port. Many a tear will witness our separation, many a wish will be wafted in a sigh that the gale may be propitious; of what my feelings will be at parting, the reader must form an idea, just as a painter conceals a face his pencil cannot    express, and leaves that description of the torne heart it ought to convey to the imagination of the spectator.  And now, gentle reader, if I pant for peace, for ease, for tranquility, after so much turbulence and trouble; if I prefer content and retirement to restleness and bustle; a quiet spot to a busy world; an unknown obscure corner, to my own magnificent and flourishing country; think me not lost to ambition, to pride, to curiosity, to popularity, I am a mortal and possess them all.  Rather commend me, that made up of passions in common with my fellow creatures, I am content to wage no future war with destiny. Look at my fortune and confess me born, not for myself, but for an example to others. Blame me not if I have learnt to know, that, in the world, friendship is a name, fame a bubble, honour a jest, merit a but for envy, beauty    the ridicule of impudence, and virtue the prey of slander. Be not hard with me if I grieve, that from the moment of my obscure birth to the moment of my sequestration from the world, I never found, except in my dear brother, and those who retire with me, a single disinterested friend.  Let unprecedented considerations excuse unprecedented conduct; and if, at last, I err, and in my error embrace my fate, let it induce, for my consolation, and for your pity, a recollection of his Divine words, who has benificently taught us, that "THERE IS AN ESPECIAL PROVIDENCE IN THE FALL OF A SPARROW."

GoldWL.txt	0	10.0	1954	Golding, William	Lord of the Flies	one      THE SOUND OF THE SHELL            THE BOY with fair hair lowered himself down the last few feet of rock and began to pick his way toward the lagoon. Though he had taken off his school sweater and trailed it now from one hand, his grey shirt stuck to him and his hair was plastered to his forehead. All round him the long scar smashed into the jungle was a bath of heat. He was clambering heavily among the creepers and broken trunks when a bird, a vision of red and yellow, flashed upwards with a witch-like cry; and this cry was echoed by another.    “Hi!” it said. “Wait a minute!”    The undergrowth at the side of the scar was shaken and a multitude of raindrops fell pattering.    “Wait a minute,” the voice said. “I got caught up.”    The fair boy stopped and jerked his stockings with an automatic gesture that made the jungle seem for a moment like the Home Counties.    The voice spoke again.    “I can’t hardly move with all these creeper things.”    The owner of the voice came backing out of the undergrowth so that twigs scratched on a greasy wind-breaker. The naked crooks of his knees were plump, caught and scratched by thorns. He bent down, removed the thorns carefully, and turned around. He was shorter than the fair boy and very fat. He came forward, searching out safe lodgments for his feet, and then looked up through thick spectacles. 
GoldWL.txt	1	3.0	1954	Golding, William	Lord of the Flies	  “Where’s the man with the megaphone?”    The fair boy shook his head.    “This is an island. At least I think it’s an island. That’s a reef out in the sea. Perhaps there aren’t any grownups anywhere.”    The fat boy looked startled.    “There was that pilot. But he wasn’t in the passenger cabin, he was up in front.”    The fair boy was peering at the reef through screwed-up eyes.    “All them other kids,” the fat boy went on. “Some of them must have got out. They must have, mustn’t they?”    The fair boy began to pick his way as casually as possible toward the water. He tried to be offhand and not too obviously uninterested, but the fat boy hurried after him.    “Aren’t there any grownups at all?”    “I don’t think so.”    The fair boy said this solemnly; but then the delight of a realized ambition overcame him. In the middle of the scar he stood on his head and grinned at the reversed fat boy.    “No grownups!”    The fat boy thought for a moment.    “That pilot.”    The fair boy allowed his feet to come down and sat on the steamy earth.    “He must have flown off after he dropped us. He couldn’t land here. Not in a plane with wheels.”    “We was attacked!”    “He’ll be back all right.”    The fat boy shook his head. 
GoldWL.txt	3	2.0	1954	Golding, William	Lord of the Flies	  “My auntie told me not to run,” he explained, “on account of my asthma.”    “Ass-mar?”    “That’s right. Can’t catch my breath. I was the only boy in our school what had asthma,” said the fat boy with a touch of pride. “And I’ve been wearing specs since I was three.”    He took off his glasses and held them out to Ralph, blinking and smiling, and then started to wipe them against his grubby wind-breaker. An expression of pain and inward concentration altered the pale contours of his face. He smeared the sweat from his cheeks and quickly adjusted the spectacles on his nose.    “Them fruit.”    He glanced round the scar.    “Them fruit,” he said, “I expect—”    He put on his glasses, waded away from Ralph, and crouched down among the tangled foliage.    “I’ll be out again in just a minute—”    Ralph disentangled himself cautiously and stole away through the branches. In a few seconds the fat boy’s grunts were behind him and he was hurrying toward the screen that still lay between him and the lagoon. He climbed over a broken trunk and was out of the jungle. 
GoldWL.txt	25	5.0	1954	Golding, William	Lord of the Flies	  “You told ’em. After what I said.”    His face flushed, his mouth trembled.    “After I said I didn’t want—”    “What on earth are you talking about?”    “About being called Piggy. I said I didn’t care as long as they didn’t call me Piggy; an’ I said not to tell and then you went an’ said straight out—”    Stillness descended on them. Ralph, looking with more understanding at Piggy, saw that he was hurt and crushed. He hovered between the two courses of apology or further insult.    “Better Piggy than Fatty,” he said at last, with the directness of genuine leadership, “and anyway, I’m sorry if you feel like that. Now go back, Piggy, and take names. That’s your job. So long.”    He turned and raced after the other two. Piggy stood and the rose of indignation faded slowly from his cheeks. He went back to the platform.    The three boys walked briskly on the sand. The tide was low and there was a strip of weed-strewn beach that was almost as firm as a road. A kind of glamour was spread over them and the scene and they were conscious of the glamour and made happy by it. They turned to each other, laughing excitedly, talking, not listening. The air was bright. Ralph, faced by the task of translating all this into an explanation, stood on his head and fell over. When they had done laughing, Simon stroked Ralph’s arm shyly; and they had to laugh again. 
GoldWL.txt	46	30.0	1954	Golding, William	Lord of the Flies	  “My specs!” howled Piggy. “Give me my specs!”    Ralph stood away from the pile and put the glasses into Piggy’s groping hands. His voice subsided to a mutter.    “Jus’ blurs, that’s all. Hardly see my hand—”    The boys were dancing. The pile was so rotten, and now so tinder-dry, that whole limbs yielded passionately to the yellow flames that poured upwards and shook a great beard of flame twenty feet in the air. For yards round the fire the heat was like a blow, and the breeze was a river of sparks. Trunks crumbled to white dust.    Ralph shouted.    “More wood! All of you get more wood!”    Life became a race with the fire and the boys scattered through the upper forest. To keep a clean flag of flame flying on the mountain was the immediate end and no one looked further. Even the smallest boys, unless fruit claimed them, brought little pieces of wood and threw them in. The air moved a little faster and became a light wind, so that leeward and windward side were clearly differentiated. On one side the air was cool, but on the other the fire thrust out a savage arm of heat that crinkled hair on the instant. Boys who felt the evening wind on their damp faces paused to enjoy the freshness of it and then found they were exhausted. They flung themselves down in the shadows that lay among the shattered rocks. The beard of flame diminished quickly; then the pile fell inwards with a soft, cindery sound, and sent a great tree of sparks upwards that leaned away and drifted downwind. The boys lay, painting like dogs. 
GoldWL.txt	50	120.0	1954	Golding, William	Lord of the Flies	Beneath the dark canopy of leaves and smoke the fire laid hold on the forest and began to gnaw. Acres of black and yellow smoke rolled steadily toward the sea. At the sight of the flames and the irresistible course of the fire, the boys broke into shrill, excited cheering. The flames, as though they were a kind of wild life, crept as a jaguar creeps on its belly toward a line of birch-like saplings that fledged an outcrop of the pink rock. They flapped at the first of the trees, and the branches grew a brief foliage of fire. The heart of flame leapt nimbly across the gap between the trees and then went swinging and flaring along the whole row of them. Beneath the capering boys a quarter of a mile square of forest was savage with smoke and flame. The separate noises of the fire merged into a drum-roll that seemed to shake the mountain.    “You got your small fire all right.”    Startled, Ralph realized that the boys were falling still and silent, feeling the beginnings of awe at the power set free below them. The knowledge and the awe made him savage.    “Oh, shut up!”    “I got the conch,” said Piggy, in a hurt voice. “I got a right to speak.”    They looked at him with eyes that lacked interest in what they saw, and cocked ears at the drum-roll of the fire. Piggy glanced nervously into hell and cradled the conch. 
GoldWL.txt	55	30.0	1954	Golding, William	Lord of the Flies	  At length he let out his breath in a long sigh and opened his eyes. They were bright blue, eyes that in this frustration seemed bolting and nearly mad. He passed his tongue across dry lips and scanned the uncommunicative forest. Then again he stole forward and cast this way and that over the ground.    The silence of the forest was more oppressive than the heat, and at this hour of the day there was not even the whine of insects. Only when Jack himself roused a gaudy bird from a primitive nest of sticks was the silence shattered and echoes set ringing by a harsh cry that seemed to come out of the abyss of ages. Jack himself shrank at this cry with a hiss of indrawn breath, and for a minute became less a hunter than a furtive thing, ape-like among the tangle of trees. Then the trail, the frustration, claimed him again and he searched the ground avidly. By the trunk of a vast tree that grew pale flowers on its grey bark he checked, closed his eyes, and once more drew in the warm air; and this time his breath came short, there was even a passing pallor in his face, and then the surge of blood again. He passed like a shadow under the darkness of the tree and crouched, looking down at the trodden ground at his feet. 
GoldWL.txt	76	1.0	1954	Golding, William	Lord of the Flies	  Jack rushed toward the twins.    “The rest are making a line. Come on!”    “But—”    “—we—”    “Come on! I’ll creep up and stab—”    The mask compelled them.      Ralph climbed out of the bathing pool and trotted up the beach and sat in the shade beneath the palms. His fair hair was plastered over his eyebrows and he pushed it back. Simon was floating in the water and kicking with his feet, and Maurice was practicing diving. Piggy was mooning about, aimlessly picking up things and discarding them. The rock-pools which so fascinated him were covered by the tide, so he was without an interest until the tide went back. Presently, seeing Ralph under the palms, he came and sat by him.    Piggy wore the remainders of a pair of shorts, his fat body was golden brown, and the glasses still flashed when he looked at anything. He was the only boy on the island whose hair never seemed to grow. The rest were shock-headed, but Piggy’s hair still lay in wisps over his head as though baldness were his natural state and this imperfect covering would soon go, like the velvet on a young stag’s antlers.    “I’ve been thinking,” he said, “about a clock. We could make a sundial. We could put a stick in the sand, and then—”    The effort to express the mathematical processes involved was too great. He made a few passes instead. 
GoldWL.txt	149	1.0	1954	Golding, William	Lord of the Flies	  “Ashes. We’re on the edge of the burnt patch.”    Their footsteps and the occasional breeze were stirring up small devils of dust. Now that they stopped again, Ralph had time while he coughed to remember how silly they were. If there was no beast—and almost certainly there was no beast—in that case, well and good; but if there was something waiting on top of the mountain—what was the use of three of them, handicapped by the darkness and carrying only sticks?    “We’re being fools.”    Out of the darkness came the answer.    “Windy?”    Irritably Ralph shook himself. This was all Jack’s fault.    “’Course I am. But we’re still being fools.”    “If you don’t want to go on,” said the voice sarcastically, “I’ll go up by myself.”    Ralph heard the mockery and hated Jack. The sting of ashes in his eyes, tiredness, fear, enraged him.    “Go on then! We’ll wait here.”    There was silence.    “Why don’t you go? Are you frightened?”    A stain in the darkness, a stain that was Jack, detached itself and began to draw away.    “All right. So long.”    The stain vanished. Another took its place. 
GoldWL.txt	171	2.0	1954	Golding, William	Lord of the Flies	  Jack spoke loudly.    “This head is for the beast. It’s a gift.”    The silence accepted the gift and awed them. The head remained there, dim-eyed, grinning faintly, blood blackening between the teeth. All at once they were running away, as fast as they could, through the forest toward the open beach.      Simon stayed where he was, a small brown image, concealed by the leaves. Even if he shut his eyes the sow’s head still remained like an after-image. The half-shut eyes were dim with the infinite cynicism of adult life. They assured Simon that everything was a bad business.    “I know that.”    Simon discovered that he had spoken aloud. He opened his eyes quickly and there was the head grinning amusedly in the strange daylight, ignoring the flies, the spilled guts, even ignoring the indignity of being spiked on a stick.    He looked away, licking his dry lips.    A gift for the beast. Might not the beast come for it? The head, he thought, appeared to agree with him. Run away, said the head silently, go back to the others. It was a joke really—why should you bother? You were just wrong, that’s all. A little headache, something you ate, perhaps. Go back, child, said the head silently. 
GoldWL.txt	184	10.0	1954	Golding, William	Lord of the Flies	    “Bathing,” said Ralph, “that’s the only thing to do.”    Piggy was inspecting the looming sky through his glass.    “I don’t like them clouds. Remember how it rained just after we landed?”    “Going to rain again.”    Ralph dived into the pool. A couple of littluns were playing at the edge, trying to extract comfort from a wetness warmer than blood. Piggy took off his glasses, stepped primly into the water and then put them on again. Ralph came to the surface and squirted a jet of water at him.    “Mind my specs,” said Piggy. “If I get water on the glass I got to get out and clean ’em.”    Ralph squirted again and missed. He laughed at Piggy, expecting him to retire meekly as usual and in pained silence. Instead, Piggy beat the water with his hands.    “Stop it!” he shouted. “D’you hear?”    Furiously he drove the water into Ralph’s face.    “All right, all right,” said Ralph. “Keep your hair on.”    Piggy stopped beating the water.    “I got a pain in my head. I wish the air was cooler.”    “I wish the rain would come.”    “I wish we could go home.”    Piggy lay back against the sloping sand side of the pool. His stomach protruded and the water dried on it. Ralph squinted up at the sky. One could guess at the movement of the sun by the progress of a light patch among the clouds. He knelt in the water and looked round. 
GoldWL.txt	189	10.0	1954	Golding, William	Lord of the Flies	  “Come away. There’s going to be trouble. And we’ve had our meat.”    There was a blink of bright light beyond the forest and the thunder exploded again so that a littlun started to whine. Big drops of rain fell among them making individual sounds when they struck.    “Going to be a storm,” said Ralph, “and you’ll have rain like when we dropped here. Who’s clever now? Where are your shelters? What are you going to do about that?”    The hunters were looking uneasily at the sky, flinching from the stroke of the drops. A wave of restlessness set the boys swaying and moving aimlessly. The flickering light became brighter and the blows of the thunder were only just bearable. The littluns began to run about, screaming.    Jack leapt on to the sand.    “Do our dance! Come on! Dance!”    He ran stumbling through the thick sand to the open space of rock beyond the fire. Between the flashes of lightning the air was dark and terrible; and the boys followed him, clamorously. Roger became the pig, grunting and charging at Jack, who sidestepped. The hunters took their spears, the cooks took spits, and the rest clubs of firewood. A circling movement developed and a chant. While Roger mimed the terror of the pig, the littluns ran and jumped on the outside of the circle. Piggy and Ralph, under the threat of the sky, found themselves eager to take a place in this demented but partly secure society. They were glad to touch the brown backs of the fence that hemmed in the terror and made it governable. 
GoldWL.txt	193	120.0	1954	Golding, William	Lord of the Flies	  Somewhere over the darkened curve of the world the sun and moon were pulling, and the film of water on the earth planet was held, bulging slightly on one side while the solid core turned. The great wave of the tide moved farther along the island and the water lifted. Softly, surrounded by a fringe of inquisitive bright creatures, itself a silver shape beneath the steadfast constellations, Simon’s dead body moved out toward the open sea.            ten      THE SHELL AND    THE GLASSES            PIGGY EYED the advancing figure carefully. Nowadays he sometimes found that he saw more clearly if he removed his glasses and shifted the one lens to the other eye; but even through the good eye, after what had happened, Ralph remained unmistakably Ralph. He came now out of the coconut trees, limping, dirty, with dead leaves hanging from his shock of yellow hair. One eye was a slit in his puffy cheek and a great scab had formed on his right knee. He paused for a moment and peered at the figure on the platform.    “Piggy? Are you the only one left?”    “There’s some littluns.”    “They don’t count. No biguns?”    “Oh—Samneric. They’re collecting wood.”    “Nobody else?”    “Not that I know of.”    Ralph climbed on to the platform carefully. The coarse grass was still worn away where the assembly used to sit; the fragile white conch still gleamed by the polished seat. Ralph sat down in the grass facing the chief’s seat and the conch. Piggy knelt at his left, and for a long minute there was silence. 
GoldWL.txt	233	2.0	1954	Golding, William	Lord of the Flies	  “Samneric—”    He heard a cry and a flurry from the rock. The twins had grabbed each other and were gibbering.    “It’s me. Ralph.”    Terrified that they would run and give the alarm, he hauled himself up until his head and shoulders stuck over the top. Far below his armpit he saw the luminous flowering round the rock.    “It’s only me. Ralph.”    At length they bent forward and peered in his face.    “We thought it was—”    “—we didn’t know what it was—”    “—we thought—”    Memory of their new and shameful loyalty came to them. Eric was silent but Sam tried to do his duty.    “You got to go, Ralph. You go away now—”    He wagged his spear and essayed fierceness.    “You shove off. See?”    Eric nodded agreement and jabbed his spear in the air. Ralph leaned on his arms and did not go.    “I came to see you two.”    His voice was thick. His throat was hurting him now though it had received no wound.    “I came to see you two—”    Words could not express the dull pain of these things. He fell silent, while the vivid stars were split and danced all ways.    Sam shifted uneasily.    “Honest, Ralph, you’d better go.”    Ralph looked up again.    “You two aren’t painted. How can you—? If it were light—”    If it were light shame would burn them at admitting these things. But the night was dark. Eric took up; and then the twins started their antiphonal speech. 
GoldWL.txt	252	2.0	1954	Golding, William	Lord of the Flies	  “We saw your smoke. What have you been doing? Having a war or something?”    Ralph nodded.    The officer inspected the little scarecrow in front of him. The kid needed a bath, a haircut, a nose-wipe and a good deal of ointment.    “Nobody killed, I hope? Any dead bodies?”    “Only two. And they’ve gone.”    The officer leaned down and looked closely at Ralph.    “Two? Killed?”    Ralph nodded again. Behind him, the whole island was shuddering with flame. The officer knew, as a rule, when people were telling the truth. He whistled softly.    Other boys were appearing now, tiny tots some of them, brown, with the distended bellies of small savages. One of them came close to the officer and looked up.    “I’m, I’m—”    But there was no more to come. Percival Wemys Madison sought in his head for an incantation that had faded clean away.    The officer turned back to Ralph.    “We’ll take you off. How many of you are there?”    Ralph shook his head. The officer looked past him to the group of painted boys.    “Who’s boss here?”    “I am,” said Ralph loudly.    A little boy who wore the remains of an extraordinary black cap on his red hair and who carried the remains of a pair of spectacles at his waist, started forward, then changed his mind and stood still. 
GoldWL.txt	253	5.0	1954	Golding, William	Lord of the Flies	  “We saw your smoke. And you don’t know how many of you there are?”    “No, sir.”    “I should have thought,” said the officer as he visualized the search before him, “I should have thought that a pack of British boys—you’re all British, aren’t you?—would have been able to put up a better show than that—I mean—”    “It was like that at first,” said Ralph, “before things—”    He stopped.    “We were together then—”    The officer nodded helpfully.    “I know. Jolly good show. Like the Coral Island.”    Ralph looked at him dumbly. For a moment he had a fleeting picture of the strange glamour that had once invested the beaches. But the island was scorched up like dead wood—Simon was dead—and Jack had. . . . The tears began to flow and sobs shook him. He gave himself up to them now for the first time on the island; great, shuddering spasms of grief that seemed to wrench his whole body. His voice rose under the black smoke before the burning wreckage of the island; and infected by that emotion, the other little boys began to shake and sob too. And in the middle of them, with filthy body, matted hair, and unwiped nose, Ralph wept for the end of innocence, the darkness of man’s heart, and the fall through the air of the true, wise friend called Piggy.    The officer, surrounded by these noises, was moved and a little embarrassed. He turned away to give them time to pull themselves together; and waited, allowing his eyes to rest on the trim cruiser in the distance.
JoneJF.txt	0	1.0	1951	Jones, James	From Here to Eternity	Book One      The Transfer            Chapter 1      WHEN HE FINISHED packing, he walked out on to the third-floor porch of the barracks brushing the dust from his hands, a very neat and deceptively slim young man in the summer khakis that were still early morning fresh.    He leaned his elbows on the porch ledge and stood looking down through the screens at the familiar scene of the barracks square laid out below with the tiers of porches dark in the faces of the three-story concrete barracks fronting on the square. He was feeling a half-sheepish affection for his vantage point that he was leaving.    Below him under the blows of the February Hawaiian sun the quadrangle gasped defenselessly, like an exhausted fighter. Through the heat haze and the thin mid-morning film of the parched red dust came up a muted orchestra of sounds: the clankings of steel-wheeled carts bouncing over brick, the slappings of oiled leather slingstraps, the shuffling beat of scorched shoesoles, the hoarse expletives of irritated noncoms.    Somewhere along the line, he thought, these things have become your heritage. You are multiplied by each sound that you hear. And you cannot deny them, without denying with them the purpose of your own existence. Yet now, he told himself, you are denying them, by renouncing the place that they have given you.    In the earthen square in the center of the quad a machine gun company went listlessly through the motions of its Loading Drill. 
JoneJF.txt	1	1.5	1951	Jones, James	From Here to Eternity	  Behind him in the high-ceiling squadroom was the muffled curtain of sound that comes from men just waking and beginning to move around, testing cautiously the flooring of this world they had last night forsaken. He listened to it, hearing also the footsteps coming up behind him, but thinking of how good a thing it had been to sleep late every morning as a member of this Bugle Corps and wake up to the sounds of the line companies already outside at drill.    “You didnt pack my garrison shoes?” he asked the footsteps. “I meant to tell you. They scuff so easy.”    “They’re on the bed, both pair,” the voice behind him said. “With the clean uniforms from your wall locker you didnt want to get mussed up. I pack your diddy box and extra hangers and your field shoes in the extra barricks bag.”    “Then I guess thats everything,” the young man said. He stood up then, sighing, not a sigh of emotion but the sigh that is the relaxing of a tension. “Lets eat,” he said. “I got an hour yet before I have to report to G Company.”    “I still think you’re makin a bad mistake,” the man behind him said. 
JoneJF.txt	38	322560.0	1951	Jones, James	From Here to Eternity	  He threw the cigaret in the flat iron pot painted red and black, the Regimental colors, and watched the tail end of the Company move out the truck entrance and out of sight, then stepped down onto the slick concrete of the porch and walked along it to the Supply Room’s open door.    Milton Anthony Warden was thirty-four years old. In the eight months he had been topkicker of G Company he had wrapped that outfit around his waist like a money belt and buttoned his shirt over it. At intervals he liked to remind himself of this proud fact. He was a veritable demon for work; he liked to remind himself of that, too. He had also pulled this slovenly organization out of the pitfalls of lax administration. In fact, when he thought about it, and he often did, he had never met a man who was as amazingly adept at anything he put his hand to as was Milton Anthony Warden.    “The monk in his cell,” he taunted, entering the open one of the double doors. After the brilliant sunlight he had to pause and let his eyes adjust to the windowless Supply Room where two electric bulbs like burning tears dangling from the ends of chains increased the gloom. Ceiling-high cupboards, shelves and stacks of crates closed in heavily on the homemade desk where First-Fourth Leva, wry and bloodless as if the perpetual gloom of his castle had been transfused into his veins, sat, his thin nose greasy in a pool of light from the desk lamp, laboriously typing with two fingers. 
JoneJF.txt	80	2.0	1951	Jones, James	From Here to Eternity	  “The hell for leather Cavalryman,” Warden muttered. “Errol Flynn with fifty extra pounds.” He walked deliberately over to his desk and smashed his fist into his own rigidly blocked, flat-peaked issue hat hanging on the wall. “The son of a bitch’d try to ship me down if I bent up my hat like his.”    Back at the window, he watched Holmes climbing the outside stair to Regimental Hq, going up to Col Delbert’s office. Two aging men confabing with each other, leaders of men, patting each other on the back and looking frantically about to find someone to lead.    Warden had a theory about officers: Being an officer would make a sinner out of Christ himself. No man could swallow so much gaseous privilege and authority without having his guts inflated. The eager dewy-eyed young shavetails who left the Point prepared to become cavalier Jeb Stuarts, politician U.S. Grants, tragic R.E. Lees, fatherly Stonewall Jacksons, or Ramrod John J Pershings, heroes, each in his right, to the adoring populace who bought his plaster bust in all the 10¢ stores, had a choice of two developments. In every war there were two wars, the war for officers and the war of the enlisted man. And all the beardless shavetails grew up to be either the Stern Disciplinarian, or else the One Beloved of All His Men Who Loved Them Like a Brother. More recently there were the Holmeses who like a schizoid case tried to play both roles, and ended up a cuckold. 
JoneJF.txt	119	2.0	1951	Jones, James	From Here to Eternity	  “What the hell you think?” part of Anderson’s indignant protest came through the open door. “The best goddam bugler in the Regiment for Chrisake!”    “Yeah, but he wouldnt …” Clark said perplexedly; the rest was only a mumble as they passed beyond the door.    Prewitt dropped his cards and threw the cigaret to the floor. He moved swiftly and caught them on the stairs.    “Come back here,” he said.    Anderson’s head, amputated by the floor level, turned to face him with consternation, a balloon in suspension. The ominous insistence made his legs carry him back up the stairs before his mind had decided what to do. Clark tagged reluctantly along after his mental guide, without choice.    Prewitt wasted no time on preliminaries. “I dont want your goddamned job,” he said in a low white voice. “If I’d wanted to bugle I’d of stayed right where I was. Its a cinch I wouldnt come here and cut you out of your stinkin little job.”    Anderson shifted his feet evasively. “Well,” he said uneasily, without meeting Prewitt’s eyes, “you’re good enough you could get my job any time you wanted.”    “I know it,” Prewitt said. A white wall of anger descended over his eyes like the polar icecap descending over the globe. “But I never check a cinch into nobody—outside of a game. I dont play that way, see? If I wanted the goddam job, I wouldnt sneak in here and cutthroat you out of it.”    “Okay,” Anderson said placatingly. “Okay, Prew. Take it easy.”    “Dont call me Prew.”    Clark stood silently by, grinning embarrassedly, his soft eyes wide, looking from one to the other like the spectator at a wreck who watches a man bleed to death because he doesnt know what he should do and fears making a fool of himself. 
JoneJF.txt	167	0.4998	1951	Jones, James	From Here to Eternity	  And it seemed to him then that every human was always looking for himself, in bars, in railway trains, in offices, in mirrors, in love, especially in love, for the self of him that is there, someplace, in every other human. Love was not to give oneself, but find oneself, describe oneself. And that the whole conception had been written wrong. Because the only part of any man that he can ever touch or understand is that part of himself he recognizes in him. And that he is always looking for the way in which he can escape his sealed bee cell and reach the other airtight cells with which he is connected in the waxy comb.    And the only way that he had ever found, the only code, the only language, by which he could speak and be heard by other men, could communicate himself, was with a bugle. If you had a bugle here, he told himself, you could speak to her and be understood, you could play Fatigue Call for her, with its tiredness, its heavy belly going out to sweep somebody else’s streets when it would rather stay at home and sleep, she would understand it then.    But you havent got a bugle, himself said, not here nor any other place. Your tongue has been ripped out. All you got is two bottles, one nearly full, one nearly empty. 
JoneJF.txt	393	60.0	1951	Jones, James	From Here to Eternity	Getting out of the Schofield taxi at the big, rambling, palm camouflaged Army-Navy YMCA (with this prospect before them), they had gone immediately at once across the street for the first long drink, the best drink of them all, to the long open-fronted Black Cat Café. The Black Cat was a very successful place, being situated as it was directly across from the Y and the cabstand for all the Pearl Harbor and Schofield cabs. Everybody made for the Black Cat for that first best drink when they got in and stopped there for that last worst drink before going back, so that the Black Cat was always very crowded. And because the Black Cat was very successful and always very crowded both of them disliked it very much and felt it was fattening off their lifeblood and their hunger, and later on just before they went to Wu Fat’s they came back to the Black Cat and ordered two toasted limburger cheese sandwiches to go from the stupid Chinese sandwichman, saying they would be back and pick them up, then walked around the block once and by the time they got back the Black Cat was no longer very crowded, it was not even successful for the moment, it was empty and closed for the night with the iron latticework grill locked across the open front and there was not a soul to be seen in it, or for that matter to be seen in that block on that side of the street, and they shook hands happily (with this prospect still before them) and went for a drink to the nearest bar to celebrate the victory.

Like now, when she really wants it. Really, truly, absolutely wants it. Needs it. Like now. Oh, now. Please, now. Right now, now.”    “No. No, wait. Please wait.”    “Oh, no. Now. I cant wait. Even a little. Maybe I can, a little. Oh, no. I cant. Oh, now.”    “All right then, now. Now now now, O Jesus, Holy Jesus, now.”    “Did you?” he said. “You did. Didnt you?”    “Oh, yes,” Lorene said. “Oh, I did. Not for a long time, have I. But really, oh, I did. Really and truly and completely.”    “I wanted you to. Oh, I needed you to,” he said gratefully, and he bent his head down for her lips.    “No,” Lorene said. “Dont do that. Please dont.”    “But why? Why not?”    “Because I’d rather you wouldnt. Because it would spoil it, and I dont want to spoil it.”    “All right,” he said. “I’m sorry.”    “Dont be sorry. Its all right. But you must remember where we are. You must remember who I am.”    “To hell with that. I dont care about that.”    “But I care about it. It would make it like all the others, all the drunks, all the brutal ones. All of them, they all try to kiss you, as if in that way they could get something that all the rest dont get.”    “Yes,” Prew said.
JoneJF.txt	456	2.0	1951	Jones, James	From Here to Eternity	Because its just bad policy, thats all, very bad. Thats why.”    “But I dont see why.”    “Because I say so,” Lorene said sharply, sitting up. “Because if you ever do that, I’ll never have another thing to do with you, ever.”    “You wouldnt?” he said, hearing the seriousness in her voice now, and not feeling serious nor wanting to argue, turning it aside by making what he had said seriously into a teasing of her. “You really wouldnt?”    “No I would not.”    “But why?” he teased. “I could find you easy now, with that description. You’d stick out like a sore thumb, now.”    “Well,” Lorene said, mollified to see he was only teasing, “you had better never.”    “But why not get tanned?” he said. “You would look good tanned.” In his mind he could see her on the beach. He wondered where she lived. Sandra’s avocation was Lau Yee Chai’s, instead of the beach. He wondered where Sandra lived. “You would look fine tanned,” he said. “I’d love you tanned.”    “Would you want me to get fired?” Her voice was a smile now, in the darkness. “How many times have you been to a Honolulu whorehouse? That you dont know the girls are never tanned.”    “I guess I never noticed it.” Where in the city, where on the island, in what unsuspected blank face houses, did they live, the army of them, these women that were the only women on the Rock, for all that we might know? 
JoneJF.txt	468	2.5	1951	Jones, James	From Here to Eternity	  “Aint had a chanct,” the Chief said. “Up to now.”    “We better hurry,” Maggio said, and sprinted for his wall locker.    Prew was looking at the Chief’s moon face which revealed nothing of the startling implications of the order. “Why, that means we drill outside.”    “You guessed it right. They changed the Drill Schedule early this mornin. Looks like the rainy season’s over. You better get your leggins on.”    Prew nodded and went to his wall locker and Chief Choate lit a cigaret and stared at the knotting string of rising smoke and waited patiently for them to come back.    “Old Ike,” he said, “is been snoopin all over hell, since before breakfast, lookin for you. I tole him you run over to the PX for a pack of butts.”    “Thanks, Chief,” Prew said.    “Thanks nothing,” the Chief said. “Thanks hell.”    Angelo was feverishly finishing up his first leggin, half hitching the string end. “I always know this guy was chickenshit,” he grinned.    The Chief looked at them stolidly. “This is no twobit ass eating, kid. This here is serious. Or maybe you dint hear me? When I said Drill moves outside?”    “No, I dint,” Angelo said.    The Chief ignored him. “The word’s gone out already,” he said to Prew. “From now on its no holts barred. They goin to have practicly a free hand with you, in the field.”    Prew slipped his toe in through the leggin strap and worked it back, not saying anything. There was nothing to say. He had known for a long time it was coming, but he had not expected it to come. It was like with dying.

As long as I pay, whats it to you who you lay?”    Maureen picked up the bills. “Its nothing to me.”    “All right then.”    She leaned down and got the hidden bottle out. “Lets have a drink first.”    “Okay.”    She watched him drink. “Listen, Babyface. Goin again aint gunna do you any good. Not with what you got. You just be wasting money.” She put the money in his hand and closed his fingers over it. “You take this money and go to the nearest bar and you get yourself drunkern hell.

Stark had picked himself off a shackjob down at the Wailupe Naval Radio Station while they had had the CP out at Hanauma Bay. Some of them had seen her, and she was a hot-looking, wild, I’ll-go-as-far-as-you-will wahine, but Stark would not talk about her. So he did not enter the conversation much at the table; but he listened. He had not spoken to Warden since the night at Hickam Field except in the line of duty, and at the table he ignored Warden and Warden ignored him.    It was a typical Sunday morning breakfast, for the first weekend after payday. At least a third of the Company was not home. Another third was still in bed asleep. But the last third more than made up for the absences in the loudness of their drunken laughter and horseplay and the clashing of cutlery and halfpint milk bottles.    Warden was just going back for seconds on both hotcakes and eggs, with that voracious appetite he always had when he was drunk, when this blast shuddered by under the floor and rattled the cups on the tables and then rolled on off across the quad like a high wave at sea in a storm.

She would have to drive down. She could only drive in the daytime. She would have to drive back in the daytime, too. But it was an impossibility for him to get away from the CP in the daytime without being discovered. Even for an hour. And an hour was not long enough.    He could sneak away at night, after the switchboard relief went on. Stark had been sneaking off every night to see his wahine at the Wailupe Naval Radio Station, which was not far away. But Karen, she could not make the trip at night, not without being stopped. She could not even come down before dark and park and wait for him.    The only possible answer was a place, some place, where she could go in the afternoon and wait for him without being noticed, and then stay all night and drive back the next day. The hotels at Waikiki were out. Besides, he was ten or twelve miles from Waikiki out here on the highway, and there were no Motels or Tourist Courts on the highways of Hawaii.

HardTT.txt	0	3.0	1891	Hardy, Thomas	Tess of the D'Urbervilles	THE MAIDEN  PHASE THE FIRST  THE MAIDEN  ON an evening in the latter part of May a middle  aged man was walking homeward from Shaston to the  village of Marlott, in the adjoining Vale of Blakemore or  Blackmoor. The pair of legs that carried him were  rickety, and there was a bias in his gait which inclined  him somewhat to the left of a straight line. He occasionally  gave a smart nod, as if in confirmation of  some opinion, though he was not thinking of anything  in particular. An empty egg basket was slung upon his  arm, the nap of his hat was ruffled, a patch being quite  worn away at its brim where his thumb came in taking  it off. Presently he was met by an elderly parson astride  on a grey mare, who, as he rode, hummed a wandering  tune.  ' Good night tie ' the man with the basket  .  ' Good night, Sir John, ' said the parson.  The pedestrian, after another pace or two, halted,  and turned round.  ' Now, sir, begging your pardon ; we met last market  day on this road about this time, and I said " Good  night, " and you made reply " Good night, Sir John" as  now.'  TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES  ' I did, ' said the parson.  'And once before that — near a month ago.'  ' I may have.'  'Then what might your meaning be in calling me  " Sir John " these different times, when I be plain Jack  Durbeyfield, the haggler ?'  The parson rode a step or two nearer. 
HardTT.txt	1	2.0	1891	Hardy, Thomas	Tess of the D'Urbervilles	' It was only my whim, ' he said; and, after a  moment's hesitation : ' It was on account of a discovery  I made some little time ago, whilst I was hunting up  pedigrees for the new county history. I am Parson  Tringham, the antiquary, of Stagfoot Lane. Don'T you  really know, Durbeyfield, that you are the lineal representative  of the ancient and knightly family of the  D'Urbervilles, who derive their descent from Sir Pagan  D'Urberville, that renowned knight who came from  Normandy with William the Conqueror, as appears by  Battle Abbey Roll ?'  ' Never heard it before, sir !'  ' Well, it's true. Throw up your chin a moment, so  that I may catch the profile of your face better. Yes,  that's the D'Urberville nose and chin — a little debased.  Your ancestor was one of the twelve knights who assisted  the Lord of Estremavilla in Normandy in his conquest  of Glamorganshire. Branches of your family held manors  over all this part of England; their names appear in the  Pipe Rolls in the time of King Stephen. In the reign  of King John one of them was rich enough to give a  manor to the Knights Hospitallers; and in Edward the  Second's time your forefather Brian was summoned to  Westminster to attend the great Council there. You  declined a little in Oliver Cromwell's time, but to no  serious extent, and in Charles the Second's reign you  were made Knights of the Royal Oak for your loyalty. 
HardTT.txt	29	15.0	1891	Hardy, Thomas	Tess of the D'Urbervilles	Thus the strangers. But there were also local  customers who felt the same wish; and where there's  a will there's a way.  In a large bedroom upstairs, the window of which  was thickly curtained with a great woollen shawl lately  discarded by the landlady Mrs. Rolliver, were gathered  on this evening nearly a dozen persons, all seeking  beatitude; all old inhabitants of the nearer end of  Marlott, and frequenters of this retreat. Not only did  the distance to The Pure Drop, the fully licensed tavern  at the further part of the dispersed village, render its  accommodation practically unavailable for dwellers at  this end; but the far more serious question, the quality  of the liquor, confirmed the prevalent opinion that it  27  TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES  was better to drink with Rolliver in a corner of the  housetop than with the other landlord in a wide house.  A gaunt four post bedstead which stood in the room  afforded sitting space for several persons gathered round  three of its sides; a couple more men had elevated  themselves on a chest of drawers ; another rested on the  oak carved ' cwoffer'; two on the wash stand; another  on the stool; and thus all were, somehow, seated at  their ease. The stage of mental comfort to which they  had arrived at this hour was one wherein their souls  expanded beyond their skins, and spread their personalties  warmly through the room. In this process the chamber  and its furniture grew more and more dignified and  luxurious; the shawl hanging at the window took upon  itself the richness of tapestry; the brass handles of the  chest of drawers were as golden knockers; and the  carved bed posts seemed to have some kinship with the  magnificent pillars of Solomon's temple. 
HardTT.txt	47	840.0	1891	Hardy, Thomas	Tess of the D'Urbervilles	  ' Who said I had such a thought ?' asked Joan.  ' I fancy it is in your mind, mother. But I'Ll go.'  Rising early next day she walked to the hill town  called Shaston, and there took advantage of a van which  twice in the week ran from Shaston eastward to Chase  borough, passing near Trantridge, the parish in which  the vague and mysterious Mrs. D'Urberville had her  residence.  Tess Durbeyfield's route on this memorable morning  lay amid the northeastern undulations of the Vale in  TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES  which she had been born, and in which her life had  unfolded. The Vale of Blackmoor was to her the world,  and its inhabitants the races thereof. From the gates  and styles of Marlott she had looked down its length in  the wondering days of infancy, and what had been  mystery to her then was not much less than mystery to  her now. She had seen daily from her chamber window  towers, villages, faint white mansions; above all the  town of Shaston standing majestically on its height; its  windows shining like lamps in the evening sun. She  had hardly ever visited the place, only a small tract even  of the Vale and its environs being known to her by close  inspection. Much less had she been far outside the  valley. Every contour of the surrounding hills was as  personal to her as that of her relatives' faces; but for  what lay beyond her judgement was dependent on the  teaching of the village school, where she had held a  leading place at the time of her leaving, a year or two  before this date. 
HardTT.txt	97	5.0	1891	Hardy, Thomas	Tess of the D'Urbervilles	Tess was indignant and ashamed. She no longer  minded the loneliness of the way and the lateness  of the hour; her one object was to get away from the  whole crew as soon as possible. She knew well enough  that the better among them would repent of their passion  next day. They were all now inside the field, and she  was edging back to rush off alone when a horseman  emerged almost silently from the corner of the hedge  that screened the road, and Alec D'Urberville looked  round upon them.  ' What the devil is all this row about, workfolk' ?'  asked.  The explanation was not readily forthcoming; and,  in truth, he did not require any. Having heard their  voices while yet some way off he had ridden creepingly  forward, and learned enough to satisfy himself.  Tess was standing apart from the rest, near the gate.  He bent over towards her. ' Jump up behind me, ' he  whispered, ' and we'll get shot of the screaming cats in a  jiffy ! '  She felt almost ready to faint, so vivid was her sense  of the crisis. At almost any other moment of her life she  would have refused such proffered aid and company, as  she had refused them several times before; and now the  loneliness would not of itself have forced her to do  otherwise. But coming as the invitation did at the  82  THE MAIDEN  particular juncture when fear and indignation at these  adversaries could be transformed by a spring of the foot  into a triumph over them, she abandoned herself to her  impulse, climbed the gate, put her toe upon his instep,  and scrambled into the saddle behind him. The pair  were speeding away into the distant grey by the time  that the contentious revellers became aware of what  had happened. 
HardTT.txt	138	10.0	1891	Hardy, Thomas	Tess of the D'Urbervilles	The baby's offence against society in coming into the  world was forgotten by the girl mother; her soul's desire  was to continue that offence by preserving the life of the  child. However, it soon grew clear that the hour of  emancipation for that little prisoner of the flesh was to  arrive earlier than her worst misgivings had conjectured.  And when she had discovered this she was plunged into  a misery which transcended that of the child's simple  loss. Her baby had not been baptised.  Tess had drifted into a frame of mind which accepted  passively the consideration that if she should have to  burn for what she had done, burn she must, and there  was an end of it. Like all village girls she was well  grounded in the Holy Scriptures, and had dutifully  studied the histories of Aholah and Aholibah, and  knew the inferences to be drawn therefrom. But when  the same question arose with regard to the baby, it had  a very different colour. Her darling was about to die,  and no salvation.  It was nearly bedtime, but she rushed downstairs and  asked if she might send for the parson. The moment  happened to be one at which her father's sense of the  antique nobility of his family was highest, and his  sensitiveness to the smudge which Tess had set upon  that nobility most pronounced, for he had just returned  from his weekly booze at Rolliver's Inn. No parson  should come inside his door, he declared, prying into  117  TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES  his affairs, just then, when, by her shame, it had become  more necessary than ever to hide them. He locked the  door and put the key in his pocket. 
HardTT.txt	143	480.0	1891	Hardy, Thomas	Tess of the D'Urbervilles	Poor Sorrow's campaign against sin, the world, and  the devil was doomed to be of limited brilliancy — luckily  perhaps for himself, considering his beginnings. In the  blue of the morning that fragile soldier and servant  120  MAIDEN NO MORE  breathed his last, and when the other children awoke  they cried bitterly, and begged Sissy to have another  pretty baby.  The calmness which had possessed Tess since the  christening remained with her in the infant's loss. In  the daylight, indeed, she felt her terrors about his soul  to have been somewhat exaggerated; whether well  founded or not she had no uneasiness now, reasoning  that if Providence would not ratify such an act of approximation  she, for one, did not value the kind of heaven  lost by the irregularity — either for herself or for her  child.  So passed away Sorrow the Undesired — that intrusive  creature, that bastard gift of shameless Nature who  respects not the civil law; a waif to whom eternal Time  had been a matter of days merely, who knew not that  such things as years and centuries ever were ; to whom  the cottage interior was the universe, the week's weather  climate, newborn babyhood human existence, and the  instinct to suck human knowledge. 
HardTT.txt	177	14400.0	1891	Hardy, Thomas	Tess of the D'Urbervilles	At first he lived up above entirely, reading a good  deal, and strumming upon an old harp which he had  bought at a sale, saying when in a bitter humour that he  might have to get his living by it in the streets some  day. But he soon preferred to read human nature by  taking his meals downstairs in the general dining kitchen,  with the dairyman and his wife, and the maids and men,  TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES  who all together formed a lively assembly; for though  but few milking hands slept in the house, several joined  the family at meals. The longer Clare resided here the  less objection had he to his company, and the more did  he like to share quarters with them in common.  Much to his surprise he took, indeed, a real delight  in their companionship. The conventional farm folk of  his imagination — personified by the pitiable dummy  known as Hodge — were obliterated after a few days'  residence. At close quarters no Hodge was to be  seen. At first, it is true, when Clare's intelligence was  fresh from a contrasting society, these friends with whom  he now hobnobbed seemed a little strange. Sitting  down as a level member of the dairyman's household  seemed at the outset an undignified proceeding. The  ideas, the modes, the surroundings, appeared retrogressive  and unmeaning. But with living on there, day after  day, the acute sojourner became conscious of a new  aspect in the spectacle. Without any objective change  whatever, variety had taken the place of monotonousness. 
HardTT.txt	195	60480.0	1891	Hardy, Thomas	Tess of the D'Urbervilles	Dairyman Crick's household of maids and men lived  on comfortably, placidly, even merrily. Their position  was perhaps the happiest of all positions in the social  scale, being above the line at which neediness ends, and  below the line at which the convenances begin to cramp  natural feeling, and the stress of threadbare modishness  makes too little of enough.  Thus passed the leafy time when arborescence seems  to be the one thing aimed at out of doors. Tess and  Clare unconsciously studied each other, ever balanced  on the edge of a passion, yet apparently keeping out of  it. All the while they were converging, under an irresistible  law, as surely as two streams in one vale.  Tess had never in her recent life been so happy as  she was now, possibly never would be so happy again.  She was, for one thing, physically and mentally suited  165  TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES  among these new surroundings. The sapling which had  rooted down to a poisonous stratum on the spot of its  sowing had been transplanted to a deeper soil. Moreover  she, and Clare also, stood as yet on the debatable  land between predilection and love; where no profundities  have been reached; no reflections have set in,  awkwardly inquiring, 'Whither does this new current  tend to carry me ? What does it mean to my future ? 
HardTT.txt	213	20160.0	1891	Hardy, Thomas	Tess of the D'Urbervilles	From this day she forced herself to take pains to  avoid him — never allowing herself, as formerly, to remain  long in his company, even if their juxtaposition were  purely accidental. She gave the other three every  chance.  Tess was woman enough to realise from their avowals  to herself that Angel Clare had the honour of all the  dairymaids in his keeping, and her perception of his care  to avoid compromising the happiness of either in the  least degree bred a tender respect in Tess for what she  deemed, rightly or wrongly, the self controlling sense of  duty shown by him, a quality which she had never expected  to find in one of the opposite sex, and in the  absence of which more than one of the simple hearts  who were his housemates might have gone weeping on  her pilgrimage.  i Si  TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES  XXIII  I HE hot weather of July had crept upon them unawares,  and the atmosphere of the flat vale hung heavy  as an opiate over the dairy folk, the cows, and the trees.  Hot steaming rains fell frequently, making the grass  where the cows fed yet more rank, and hindering the  late haymaking in the other meads.  It was Sunday morning; the milking was done; the  outdoor milkers had gone home. Tess and the other  three were dressing themselves rapidly, the whole bevvy  having agreed to go together to Mellstock Church, which  lay some three or four miles distant trom the dairy  house. She had now been two months at Talbothays,  and this was her first excursion. 
HardTT.txt	290	10.0	1891	Hardy, Thomas	Tess of the D'Urbervilles	But O, I sometimes wish I had  never been born !'  ' Now, my dear Tess, if I did not know that you are  very much excited, and very inexperienced, I should  say that remark was not very complimentary. How  came you to wish that if you care for me ? Do you  care for me ? I wish you would prove it in some way.'  ' How can I prove it more than I have done ?' she  cried, in a distraction of tenderness. ' Will this prove  it more ?'  She clasped his neck, and for the first time Clare  learned what an impassioned woman's kisses were like  upon the lips of one whom she loved with all her heart  and soul, as Tess loved him.  ' There — now do you believe ?' she asked, flushed,  and wiping her eyes.  ' Yes. I never really doubted — never, never !'  So they drove on through the gloom, forming one  bundle inside the sail cloth, the horse going as he would,  and the rain driving against them. She had consented.  She might as well have agreed at first. The ' appetite  for joy' which prevades all creation, that tremendous  force which sways humanity to its purpose, as the tide  sways the helpless weed, was not to be controlled by  vague lucubrations over the social rubric. 
HardTT.txt	463	360.0	1891	Hardy, Thomas	Tess of the D'Urbervilles	Beauty to her, as to all who have felt, lay not in the  thing, but in what the thing symbolised.  Keeping the Vale on her right she steered steadily  westward; passing above the Hintocks, crossing at right  angles the highroad from Sherton abbas to Casterbridge,  and skirting Dogbury Hill and High stoy, with the dell  between them called 'The Devil's Kitchen.' Still following  the elevated way she reached cross in hand,  where the stone pillar stands desolate and silent, to  mark the site of a miracle, or murder, or both. Three  miles farther she cut across the straight and deserted  Roman road called Long ash Lane ; leaving which as  soon as she reached it she dipped down the hill by a  transverse lane into the small town or village of Evers  head, being now about halfway over the distance. She  made a halt here, and breakfasted a second time, heartily  enough — not at the sow and acorn, for she avoided inns,  but at a cottage by the church.  The second half of her journey was through a more  gentle country, by way of Benvill Lane. But as the  mileage lessened between her and the spot of her pilgrimage,  so did Tess's confidence decrease, and her  enterprise loom out more formidably. She saw her  purpose in such staring lines, and the landscape so  faintly, that she was sometimes in danger of losing her  way. However, about noon she paused by a gate on  the edge of the basin in which Emminster and its  Vicarage lay.

' Don'T speak against 'n — he is absent!' she cried  excitedly. 'Treat him honourable — he has never  wronged you! O leave his wife before any scandal  spreads that may do grievous harm to his honest  name !'  ' I will — I will, ' he said, like a man awakening from  a lurid dream. ' I have broken my engagement to  preach to those poor drunken sinners at the fair — it is  the first time I have done such a monstrous thing! A  month ago I should have been horrified at such a  possibility. I'Ll go away — to hide — and — ah, can I!  pray.' Then, suddenly: 'One clasp, Tessy — one!  Only for old friendship '  ' O stop! I am 'ithout defence, Alec! A good man's  honour is in my keeping — think — be ashamed !'  ' O yes — yes ! My God !'  He clenched his lips, mortified with himself for his  weakness. His eyes were equally barren of amatory  and religious hope. The corpses of those old black  passions which had lain inanimate amid the lines of his  face ever since his reformation seemed to wake and  come together as in a resurrection. He went out  indeterminately, hardly responsible for his acts.

' I have done it — I don't know how, ' she continued.  ' Still, I owed it to 'ee, and to myself, Angel.

Their  pale faces seemed to have shrunk to half their natural  size. They moved on hand in hand, and never spoke  a word, the drooping of their heads being that of Giotto's  ' Two Apostles.'  When they had nearly reached the top of the great  West Hill the clocks in the town struck eight . Each  gave a start at the notes, and, walking onward yet a few  steps, they reached the first milestone, standing whitely  on the green margin of the grass, and backed by the  down, which here was open to the road. They entered  upon the turf, and, impelled by a force which seemed to  overrule their will, suddenly stood still, turned, and  waited in paralysed suspense beside the stone.  The prospect from this summit was almost unlimited.  In the valley beneath lay the city they had just left, its  more prominent buildings showing as in an isometric  drawing — among them the broad cathedral tower, with  its Norman windows and immense length of aisle and  nave, the spires of St. Thomas's, the pinnacled tower  of the College, and, more to the right, the tower and  gables of the ancient hospice, where to this day the  pilgrim may receive his dole of bread and ale. Behind  the city swept the rotund upland of St. Catherine's Hill;  further off, landscape beyond landscape, till the horizon  was lost in the radiance of the sun hanging above it. 
HardTT.txt	627	10.0	1891	Hardy, Thomas	Tess of the D'Urbervilles	Against these far stretches of country rose, in front  of the other city edifices, a large redbrick building, with  level grey roofs, and rows of short barred windows  bespeaking captivity, the whole contrasting greatly by its  formalism with the quaint irregularities of the Gothic  erections. It was somewhat disguised from the road in  passing it by yews and evergreen oaks, but it was visible  enough up here. The wicket from which the pair had  FULFILMENT  lately emerged was in the wall of this structure. From  the middle of the building an ugly flat-topped octagonal  tower ascended against the east horizon, and viewed  from this spot, on its shady side and against the light,  it seemed the one blot on the city's beauty. Yet it was  with this blot, and not with the beauty, that the two  gazers were concerned.  Upon the cornice of the tower a tall staff was fixed.  Their eyes were riveted on it. A few minutes after the  hour had struck something moved slowly up the staff,  and extended itself upon the breeze. It was a black  flag.  ' Justice' was done, and the President of the Immortals  (in ^Eschylean phrase) had ended his sport with Tess.  And the D'Urberville knights and dames slept on in  their tombs unknowing. The two speechless gazers  bent themselves down to the earth, as if in prayer, and  remained thus a long time, absolutely motionless: the  flag continued to wave silently. As soon as they had  strength they arose, joined hands again, and went on.  THE END
ProuASN.txt	0	18921600.0	1993	Proulx, Annie	The Shipping News	    1    Quoyle    Quoyle: A coil of rope.    “A Flemish flake is a spiral coil of one layer only. It is made on deck, so that it may be walked on if necessary.”    THE ASHLEY BOOK OF KNOTS          HERE is an account of a few years in the life of Quoyle, born in Brooklyn and raised in a shuffle of dreary upstate towns.    Hive-spangled, gut roaring with gas and cramp, he survived childhood; at the state university, hand clapped over his chin, he camouflaged torment with smiles and silence. Stumbled through his twenties and into his thirties learning to separate his feelings from his life, counting on nothing. He ate prodigiously, liked a ham knuckle, buttered spuds.    His jobs: distributor of vending machine candy, all-night clerk in a convenience store, a third-rate newspaperman. At thirty-six, bereft, brimming with grief and thwarted love, Quoyle steered away to Newfoundland, the rock that had generated his ancestors, a place he had never been nor thought to go.    A watery place. And Quoyle feared water, could not swim. Again and again the father had broken his clenched grip and thrown him into pools, brooks, lakes and surf. Quoyle knew the flavor of brack and waterweed.    From this youngest son’s failure to dog-paddle the father saw other failures multiply like an explosion of virulent cells—failure to speak clearly; failure to sit up straight; failure to get up in the morning; failure in attitude; failure in ambition and ability; indeed, in everything. His own failure. 
ProuASN.txt	1	8409600.0	1993	Proulx, Annie	The Shipping News	  Quoyle shambled, a head taller than any child around him, was soft. He knew it. “Ah, you lout,” said the father. But no pygmy himself. And brother Dick, the father’s favorite, pretended to throw up when Quoyle came into a room, hissed “Lardass, Snotface, Ugly Pig, Warthog, Stupid, Stinkbomb, Fart-tub, Greasebag,” pummeled and kicked until Quoyle curled, hands over head, sniveling, on the linoleum. All stemmed from Quoyle’s chief failure, a failure of normal appearance.    A great damp loaf of a body. At six he weighed eighty pounds. At sixteen he was buried under a casement of flesh. Head shaped like a crenshaw, no neck, reddish hair ruched back. Features as bunched as kissed fingertips. Eyes the color of plastic. The monstrous chin, a freakish shelf jutting from the lower face.    Some anomalous gene had fired up at the moment of his begetting as a single spark sometimes leaps from banked coals, had given him a giant’s chin. As a child he invented stratagems to deflect stares; a smile, downcast gaze, the right hand darting up to cover the chin. 
ProuASN.txt	23	1.5	1993	Proulx, Annie	The Shipping News	  But the brother, a spiritual sublieutenant in the Church of Personal Magnetism, did have a phone and Quoyle had his number. Felt his gut contract when the hated voice came through the receiver. Clogged nasals, adenoidal snorts. The brother said he could not come to rites for outsiders.    “I don’t believe in those asshole superstitions,” he said. “Funerals. At CPM we have a cocktail party. Besides, where did you find a minister to say a word for suicides?”    “Reverend Stain is part of their Dignified Exit meeting group. You ought to come. At least help me clean out the basement. Father left something like four tons of old magazines down there. Look, I had to see our parents being carried out of the house.” Almost sobbed.    “Hey, Lardass, did they leave us anything?”    Quoyle knew what he meant.    “No. Big mortgage on the house. They spent their savings. I think that’s a major reason why they did this. I mean, I know they believed in dignified death, but they’d spent everything. The grocery chain went bankrupt and his pension stopped. If they’d kept on living they’d have had to go out and get jobs, clerking in the 7-Eleven or something. I thought Mother might have a pension too, but she didn’t.”    “Are you kidding? You’ve got to be dumber than I thought. Hey, Barfbag, if there’s anything send my share to me. You got my address.” He hung up. 
ProuASN.txt	81	1.5	1993	Proulx, Annie	The Shipping News	  “Quoyle!” The hand shot out and Quoyle shook it. It was like clasping a leather pot holder.    “Thick weather and small rain. Here we are, Quoyle, sitting in the headquarters of Gammy Bird. Now, you’re working at this paper, which does pretty good, and I’ll tell you how it is that I come to do this. Set you straight. Because you can see I didn’t go to the school of journalism.” Shot jets of smoke from the corners of his mouth, looked up at the ceiling as if at mariners’ stars.    “Great-great-grandfather had to go to cannibalism to stay alive. We settled Flour Sack Cove, right here, only a few families left now. Buggits fished these waters, sealed, shipped out, done everything to keep going. It used to be a good living, fishing. It was all inshore fishing when I was young. You’d have your skiff, your nets. Finding the fish was a trick. They say true ‘the fish has no bells.’ Billy Pretty one of the best to find the fish. Knew the water like the hollows in his mattress. He can name you every sunker on this coast, that’s the God’s truth.

The refinery wasn’t operative yet they said, so they helped me fill out this job application about two miles long, told me to go home and wait for the letter from Eden Falls. I’m still waiting. Yar, they started it up, all right, but there’s only a very few of jobs. So I stayed home, doing what fishing I could. Lean times. My wife was sick, we’re on the pinch end of things. It was the worst time. We’d lost our oldest boy, you know. So back I goes.    “ ‘Look, boys, things is hard. I needs a job.’ They said they had the perfect thing for me. Saving it all these trial years. And it was right across the Omaloor Bay, a glove factory! Right out there, Quoyle, right out there by your place on the point. They was going to make gloves there, leather gloves. Made it sound like the government built the thing just for me. They said I was a natural for a job due to my experience in the tannery. I was practically a master craftsman of the leather trade! I could prob’ly get an overseer’s job! Wasn’t I some glad? They got the ferry going. Big crowd showed up to go to work first day. Well, you believe it, we went over there, went inside, there was a lot of people standing around, a nice cafeteria, big stainless steel vats for dyeing, sewing machines and cutting tables. Only two things they didn’t have—somebody who knew how to make gloves, and the leather. See, the leather for the gloves was supposed to come from the tannery I worked at years before, but it had folded and nobody ever told the guys building the glove factory, nobody ever told Canada Manpower. That was that. 
ProuASN.txt	233	15.0	1993	Proulx, Annie	The Shipping News	  Billy telephoned Tert Card, leaned against the wall with a toothpick in his teeth.    “Me and Quoyle is down to Desperate Cove, fogbound. I’m going to leave my boat here if you can get us a ride back to Killick-Claw. He’s got his car over there and I left my truck down the wharf. Yeah. I’ll get it tomorrow. Wracker Quoyle here picked a valise off the Net-Man. We don’t know. It’s locked. Fog’s that thick, so you go easy. There’s no hurry. We’re eating dinner over here. Yep. No, she made Railey’s moose up into meatballs. Ar, I’ll tell her.”    Quoyle had the squid and a side dish of onion hash. The squid were stuffed with tiny pink shrimp, laid on a bed of sea parsley. Billy worked at his platter of meatballs. The waitress brought them hot rolls with butter and partridgeberry jam.    The cook stuck her long face out of the kitchen.    “I made a old-fashioned figgy duff for Railey, Skipper Billy. There’s quite a bit of it on hand. P’raps you’d like to refresh your mouth with some?”    “I would. And Tert Card is comin’ down to pick us up. He wants an order of the meatballs to go if you got enough.”    So, a dish of figgy duff with a drop of rum sauce, and coffee.    “I’m going to open that suitcase,” said Quoyle. 
ProuASN.txt	243	120960.0	1993	Proulx, Annie	The Shipping News	  The aunt’s interest in fixing up slowed, veered to something private in her own room where she lay on the bed staring at the ceiling for as long as an hour. Or got up with a yawn, a short laugh, said, Well, let’s see now. Coming back from wherever she’d been.    Weekends came to this: the aunt in her room or stirring something or out for a walk. Quoyle hacking his path to the sea, the children squatting in the moss to watch insects toil up stems. Or he split wood against future cold. Thought of Partridge, fired up to cook new dishes and let the children dabble their fingers in mixes and slops, and sometimes let Bunny use the paring knife. While he hovered.    In late August a bowl of cleaned squid stood on the kitchen shelf. Quoyle’s intention: calamari linguine when he was done with the painting. Because he owed Partridge a letter. The aunt declared a salad despite fainting lettuce and pale hothouse tomatoes.    “We could have put in a little garden,” she said. “Raised our own salads at least. The stuff at the markets is not fit to eat. Celery brown with rot, lettuce looks like it’s been boiled.”    “Wavey,” said Quoyle, “Wavey says Alexanders is better than spinach. You can pick it all along the shore here.”    “Never heard of it,” said the aunt. “I’m not one for wild plants.”    “It’s like wild sea parsley,” said Quoyle. “I might put some in the calamari sauce.”    “Yes,” said the aunt. “You try it. Whatever it is.” But went to scout a suitable garden patch among the rocks. Not too late to sow lettuce seed. Thinking a glass house would be a good thing.

Oh yes, Mr. Quoyle’s bloody precious column! It’s against our whole effort of development and economic progress.”    And he rewrote the piece, pasted it up with bold fingers, went out and got drunk. To quell the pain of the irksome canker sores. How could they know he swallowed glassful after glassful to comprehend a harsh and private beauty?        A day or two later Tert Card brought in a framed picture from a shipping company’s wall calendar. He hung it behind his desk. The gargantuan Quiet Eye nosed through a sunset into Placentia Bay. LARGEST OIL TANKER IN THE WORLD. The first time the door slammed it went askew.    Quoyle thought it was funny until noon when Card came back from the printer with the ink-smelling bundles of Gammy Bird. Took a copy, turned to see how his Shipping News story came out. His column had been condensed to a caption accompanying the same calendar page photo that hung on Tert Card’s wall.    PICTURE OF AN OIL TANKER    More than 3,000 tankers proudly ride the world’s seas. These giant tankers, even the biggest, take advantage of Newfoundland’s deep-water ports and refineries. Oil and Newfoundland go together like ham and eggs, and like ham and eggs they’ll nourish us all in the coming years.    Let’s all hang a picture of an oil tanker on our wall. 
ProuASN.txt	288	480.0	1993	Proulx, Annie	The Shipping News	  Last Friday Harold Nightingale had enough. He told his wife he was going out to haul his traps for the last time. He wrote out an advertisement for his boat and gear and asked her to place it in the Gammy Bird.    He and his four-man crew spent the morning hauling traps (all were empty) and were on their way back in when the wind increased slightly. A moderate sea built up and several waves broke over the aft deck. Just outside the entrance of Port Anguish harbor the boat heeled over to starboard and did not recover. Skipper Nightingale and the crew managed to scramble into the dories and abandon the sinking boat. The vessel disappeared beneath the waves and they headed for shore. The boat was not insured.    “The worst of it is that she sank under the weight of empty traps. I would have taken a little comfort if it had been a load of fish.” On his arrival at home Mr. Nightingale canceled his classified ad.    “Ha-ha,” said Tert Card. “I remember him calling up about that ad.”    Quoyle slumped at his desk, thinking of old men standing in the rain, telling him how it had been. Of Harold Nightingale whose lifework ended like a stupid joke.

Her arms come smooth as silk, they did, it was a pleasure to be squeezed by ‘em. So they all said. I hope that’s not the extent of your foreign news, Nutbeem, hair removal in Ontario.”    “Well, there’s the cholera epidemic in Peru. Argentina and Paraguay now refuse to play soccer in Peru. Fourteen thousand cases have been reported in the last six weeks.”    “Good. We’ll run that story next to the one on unknown insects biting employees in the Social Service office in Misky Bay after a recent influx of Peruvian immigrants.” He looked at Quoyle. “Have you got a wreck, buddy?”    “Um,” said Quoyle. Giving nothing to Tert Card.    “Well, then, what is it, where is it and did you get pictures?”    “The ship collision on Strain Bag. Then I shot a couple of frames of a vehicle fire—unexplained causes. Truck was parked in front of the funeral home and just burst into flames while the family was inside. Looked like a roasting pan on fire.”    “That’s a very good tip, Quoyle. If we ever get hard up for pictues we can get a roasting pan, fill it up with oil and set it on fire. Jiggle the camera a little when we take snaps.

You used to wind them up. Every day. S’elp me, it’s true! Every day. Life was terrible ‘ard in the old days. So! Calls Leander up on the telephone. It was a local call. No charge.” She became an uncanny Billy Pretty, hooped over the phone.    “ ‘Leander,’ he says. ‘Leander, what would you ask to repair me old grandfather clock that’s ‘ere in me kitchen the ‘undred years past. I winds it up with a key. It is not battery operated.’    “ ‘Ah,’ says Leander. ‘Could be about a hundred and ten dollars. The cost comes in getting it ‘ere. Pickup and delivery. Got to charge fifty each way. Got to ‘ire two strong lads, gas and oil for the truck. Insurance. Air in the tires.’    “ ‘There’s no cost to air in the tires,’ says Billy.    “ ‘Where ‘ave you been, Billy? ‘Tis called ‘inflation.’    “Well, m’dears, Billy thought about it a bit. We knows ‘e lives up on the ‘ill and Leander’s ‘ouse is down at the bottom and in between a dozen streets. Billy ‘as it all figured out. ‘E’ll carry the clock down to Leander ‘imself. Save fifty dollars. Leander can bring it back. Uphill. After all, it’s not that it’s all that ‘eavy, being mostly an empty space for the pendulum, but it’s awkward. Very awkward.” She measured off the dimensions of the grandfather clock, reaching high with the cane to touch the wooden dove that everyone knew topped Billy’s clock, widening her arms, stooping and dusting a bit of lint from the carved fruitwood foot. Quoyle twisted around, saw Billy roaring with pleasure at the resurrection of his clock on the stage. Someone in the audience went TICK TOCK. 
ProuASN.txt	380	10.0	1993	Proulx, Annie	The Shipping News	Remember how there was never enough paper clips? Quoyle, they shot at Mercalia on the freeway last week. Show you how crazy the scene is, I made a joke about living in California, about LA style. Fucking bullet holes through her windshield. Missed her by inches. She’s scared to death and I’m making jokes. It hit me after Edna called what a fucking miserable crazy place we’re in. There’s no place you can go no more without getting shot or burned or beat. And I was laughing.” And Quoyle thought he heard his friend crying on the other side of the continent. Or maybe he was laughing again.        A deep smell to the air, some elusive taste that made him pull in conscious breaths. Sky the straw-colored ichor that seeps from a wound. Rust blossoms along the station wagon’s door panels. He could have been dead in Mockingburg, New York.    Jack stood in the skiff, pronging cod onto the stage. Quoyle pulled on a slicker, his gloves. He seized his knife, picked up a cod. In the beginning it had seemed a strange way to conduct an editorial meeting.    “Hands might as well be doing something while we talk,” said Jack, scrambling up. “Always hated the sight of five, six grown men sitting around a table, doing nothing but work their jaw. You see them doodle away, rip pieces of paper, wagging their foot, fooling with paper clips.”    Quoyle didn’t want to think about paper clips. Told Jack about the machine gunner, the random shot on the freeway, the riots. 
ProuASN.txt	398	2.0	1993	Proulx, Annie	The Shipping News	  “Is it the boy?”    Quoyle shook his head. How to say it? That he loved Petal, not Wavey, that all the capacity for love in him had burned up in one fast go. The moment had come and the spark ignited, and for some it never went out. For Quoyle, who equated misery with love. All he felt with Wavey was comfort and a modest joy.    But said, “It’s Herold. Her husband. He’s always in her mind. She’s very deeply attached to his memory.”    “ ’Erold Prowse!” The old man closed the door. “Let me tell you something about ‘Erold Prowse. There was a sigh of relief went up in some places when he was lost. You’ve heard of the tomcat type of feller, eh? That was ‘Erold. He sprinkled his bastards up and down the coast from St. John’s to Go Aground. It was like a parlor game down in Misky Bay to take a squint at babies and young children, see if they looked like ‘Erold. ‘Appen they often did.”    “Did Wavey know this?”    “Of course she knew. ‘E made her life some miserable. Rubbed her nose in it, ‘e did. Went off for weeks and months, swarvin’ around. No sir, boy, don’t you worry about ‘Erold. Far as keeping ‘Erold’s memory green and sacred goes, of course ‘e turned into a tragic figure. What else could she do? And then there was the boy. Can’t tell a lad born under those circumstances that ‘is dad was a rat. I know she makes a song and dance about ‘Erold. But ‘ow far does that get ‘er?” He opened the door again. 
ProuASN.txt	432	720.0	1993	Proulx, Annie	The Shipping News	  Wavey fell against him like a cut sapling, tears wetting his shirt. Quoyle backed against the sink in her little kitchen. He said he would drive Herry and Bunny to school to keep balance in their day. Sunshine would stay with Wavey, who, after the brief luxury of Quoyle’s shoulder, was making school lunches. Not to trouble Beety.    A stillness. Mist the depth of a hand on the water, blurred the jumbled shore. Rock ledges like black metal straps held the sea to the land. Quoyle inhaled, cold air rushed up his nose and he was guilty because Jack was dead and here he was, still breathing.        Paper-faced Billy had every detail, had gone to the wharf the night before, had put his hand on Mrs. Buggit’s arm, touched Dennis’s shoulder and said he was sorry for their trouble. Had seen Jack brought back to the house and carried in. Helped pull Jack’s clothes off, cover him with a sheet. Observed the matching mole below his left nipple that, when balanced by the eye against the right nipple, suggested punctuation ready for an inscription to be written around the torso.          Had seen Mrs. Buggit and her sisters with the basins of water and scissors to prepare Jack for his suit, to shave and tonsure, to clip his nails. An embroidered pillow was ready to put under his head, brought from a trunk, the tissue unfolded. His Voyage Ended. Worked decades before in the north light of the window.

Maybe they made a mistake like Uncle Jack.”    “Oh Bunny, I’m sorry to say it but she is really and truly dead. Like the little bird was dead because its neck was broken. Some hurts are so bad they can’t get better.”    “Was Petal’s neck broken?”    “Yes. Her neck was broken.”    “Dennis’s friend Carl got a broken neck and he’s not dead. He just has to wear a big collar.”    “His neck was only a little bit broken.”    Silence. Bunny picked at the crocheted stars of the bedspread. Wavey saw the questions would come for a long time, that the child was gauging the subtleties and degrees of existence. Downstairs the hubbub and laughing increased. Upstairs, difficult questions. Why was one spared and another lost? Why did one rise and not another? Ah, she could be years and years explaining and never clear up the mysteries. But would try.    “Wavey. Can we go see if the bird’s still there?” Tense little fingers, pulling the crocheted work.    “Yes,” she said. “We’ll go look. But remember we had a bad storm and such a small thing as a dead bird could blow away, or the waves come up and take it. Or maybe a gull or cat claim it for a lunch. Chances are we won’t find it. Come on. We’ll see if Ken will give us a ride. Then we’ll go to my house and I’ll make cocoa.”        The rock was there, but no bird. A small feather in a tuft of grass. It could have come from any bird. Bunny picked it up. 
ProuASN.txt	443	80640.0	1993	Proulx, Annie	The Shipping News	  “It flew away.”        In the weeks that followed Jack’s resurrection, his slow gain on the pneumonia and voicelessness that followed, he whispered out details of his round trip to the far shore and back.    Decent kind of a day. Not many lobsters but some. On the way in the motor had run bad. Then quit. Flashlight battery dead. Fiddled with the motor in the dark for two hours and couldn’t get it running. Couple of skiffs went past, he shouted for a tow. Didn’t hear him. Later and later. Thought he’d be there all night. Flicked his lighter and looked at his watch. Five to ten. Skipper Tom meowing and hopping around like he had the itch. Then dumped a load of cat crap all over a lobster trap. Jack threw it overboard to rinse it, and that’s all she wrote buddy, he was jerked into the water. Pulled at the cord on his belt attached to his knife. Felt the knot slip, the knife strike him on the side of the head as it fell. Breathed water. Convulsed. Peed and shat and twisted. And as consciousness faded, came to believe vividly that he was in an enormous pickle jar. Waiting for someone to draw him out.        Quoyle experienced moments in all colors, uttered brilliancies, paid attention to the rich sound of waves counting stones, he laughed and wept, noticed sunsets, heard music in rain, said I do. A row of shining hubcaps on sticks appeared in the front yard of the Burkes’ house. A wedding present from the bride’s father.    For if Jack Buggit could escape from the pickle jar, if a bird with a broken neck could fly away, what else might be possible? Water may be older than light, diamonds crack in hot goat’s blood, mountaintops give off cold fire, forests appear in mid-ocean, it may happen that a crab is caught with the shadow of a hand on its back, that the wind be imprisoned in a bit of knotted string. And it may be that love sometimes occurs without pain or misery.

He spoiled me to my heart's  content, if tenderness and indulgence, which  exercise a softening influence over the character  for life, can be called spoiling. My parents said  it was, and accordingly took me home in less  than two years. I had been but a very short  time at home, when my aunt Joan came to our  house on a visit. She decided that my parents  mismanaged me, and desired that I might be  given up to her. She could not take me with  her when she departed, for she had a round of  other visits to pay. I\Iy father and I were to  follow her to Lonsdale.    I was very happy on this journey. I liked to  look out of the stagecoach windows, and see the  houses and fields and hedges all running along,  while we sat still. My father told me I was  mistaken, that it was we who were moving,  while the fields and hedges remained in their  places ; but I found it very difficult to believe  him.

She intended me to marry some  great man, of whose house she should thus,  through me, become virtually mistress.    Her aim was to reduce me to utter, unquestioning  submission, to the blindest obedience, so  that when she found an eligible match for me I  should accept it at her bidding ; and then, she  should live with me, and manage my house, and  my husband, and me, through him. If I offended  her, his anger was to be my punishment.    To this end, she would not allow me to form,  or rather to express, an opinion of my own — no,      A FAMILY HISTORY. 77    not about a character in a book, or the colour of  a piece of ribbon.

Two such kindred characters as Georgiana and  Melusina could not fail to be friends. They told  each other all their past history, and great was  the surprise, many the exclamations, when it  turned out that I was the intimate friend of both.    They laid their heads together to deliver me  honourably from what Melusina declared was  " worse than Egyptian bondage."

Mrs. Trevor sat by the bedside, pale and wan ;      A FAMILY HISTORY. 171    and still, from time to time, she pressed her  clasped hands upon her breast, as if to keep in  some terrible woe, and breathed almost inaudibly,  h, God ! punish me ; spare my son!"

I  felt as if I needed the fresh air to cool my  heated brow and calm my fevered spirit, and I  walked up and down among its gay flower beds,  taking no note of their beauty. Yet I remember  how the roses against the verandah  glowed in the light of the setting sun. A  missel thrush sat upon the top of a larch tree,  and sang as if there were no sickness or death in  the world.

My mother bustled about the house, and in  the kitchen; scolded the servants, and looked after  the dinner, like Mrs. Garston and Mrs. Mil wood.  My sisters lounged about all day doing nothing.  In winter they sat with their feet on the  fender, and their gowns turned back over their  knees, to prevent their burning, talking for  hours together over all the petty gossip of the  place — head and hands equally unemployed.  In summer they sat doing the same thing at the  open window, and criticising the dress of the  passers by. They seldom opened a book ; they  rarely did anything more laborious than trimming  a bonnet or mending their stockings.  The last, indeed, was their staple employment,    2      19G A FAMILY HISTORY.    and as they never mended a pair until they had  none to put on, they declared themselves so  overdone with undarned stockings, that I  offered to help them.

In reply to this communication, I put on  my crossest f[ice, and commanded the doctor  never to climb up there again.

FitzFT.txt	0	7884000.0	1925	Fitzgerald, F. Scott	The Great Gatsby	      CHAPTER I          IN MY YOUNGER and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.    “Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”    He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth. 
FitzFT.txt	1	362880.0	1925	Fitzgerald, F. Scott	The Great Gatsby	  And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men. 
FitzFT.txt	2	39420000.0	1925	Fitzgerald, F. Scott	The Great Gatsby	  * * *    My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle Western city for three generations. The Carraways are something of a clan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on to-day.    I never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to look like him—with special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in father’s office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being the warm center of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go East and learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said, “Why—ye-es,” with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.

There is always a halt there of at least a minute, and it was because of this that I first met Tom Buchanan’s mistress.    The fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known. His acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular restaurants with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about, chatting with whomsoever he knew. Though I was curious to see her, I had no desire to meet her—but I did. I went up to New York with Tom on the train one afternoon and when we stopped by the ashheaps he jumped to his feet and, taking hold of my elbow, literally forced me from the car.    “We’re getting off,” he insisted. “I want you to meet my girl.”    I think he’d tanked up a good deal at luncheon, and his determination to have my company bordered on violence. The supercilious assumption was that on Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do.

Mr. McKee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the door. When he had gone halfway he turned around and stared at the scene—his wife and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled here and there among the crowded furniture with articles of aid, and the despairing figure on the couch, bleeding fluently, and trying to spread a copy of Town Tattle over the tapestry scenes of Versailles. Then Mr. McKee turned and continued on out the door. Taking my hat from the chandelier, I followed.    “Come to lunch some day,” he suggested, as we groaned down in the elevator.    “Where?”    “Anywhere.”    “Keep your hands off the lever,” snapped the elevator boy.    “I beg your pardon,” said Mr. McKee with dignity, “I didn’t know I was touching it.”    “All right,” I agreed, “I’ll be glad to.”    . . .

I noticed that she wore her evening-dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes—there was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.    I was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and intriguing sounds had issued from a long, many-windowed room which overhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan’s undergraduate, who was now engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who implored me to join him, I went inside.    The large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was playing the piano, and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young lady from a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of champagne, and during the course of her song she had decided, ineptly, that everything was very, very sad—she was not only singing, she was weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping, broken sobs, and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks—not freely, however, for when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky color, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets. A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face, whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair, and went off into a deep vinous sleep. 
FitzFT.txt	63	100800.0	1925	Fitzgerald, F. Scott	The Great Gatsby	  * * *    Reading over what I have written so far, I see I have given the impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me. On the contrary, they were merely casual events in a crowded summer, and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs.    Most of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the Probity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their first names, and lunched with them in dark, crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I even had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the accounting department, but her brother began throwing mean looks in my direction, so when she went on her vacation in July I let it blow quietly away.    I took dinner usually at the Yale Club—for some reason it was the gloomiest event of my day—and then I went upstairs to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour. There were generally a few rioters around, but they never came into the library, so it was a good place to work. After that, if the night was mellow, I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel, and over 33d Street to the Pennsylvania Station. 
FitzFT.txt	70	5.0	1925	Fitzgerald, F. Scott	The Great Gatsby	  All these people came to Gatsby’s house in the summer.    * * *    At nine o’clock, one morning late in July, Gatsby’s gorgeous car lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody from its three-noted horn. It was the first time he had called on me, though I had gone to two of his parties, mounted in his hydroplane, and, at his urgent invitation, made frequent use of his beach.    “Good morning, old sport. You’re having lunch with me today and I thought we’d ride up together.”    He was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American—that comes, I suppose, with the absence of lifting work or rigid sitting in youth and, even more, with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games. This quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape of restlessness. He was never quite still; there was always a tapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.    He saw me looking with admiration at his car.    “It’s pretty, isn’t it, old sport!” He jumped off to give me a better view. “Haven’t you ever seen it before?”    I’d seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream color, bright with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hat-boxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, and terraced with a labyrinth of wind-shields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory, we started to town. 
FitzFT.txt	72	2.0	1925	Fitzgerald, F. Scott	The Great Gatsby	  “What part of the Middle West?” I inquired casually.    “San Francisco.”    “I see.”    “My family all died and I came into a good deal of money.”    His voice was solemn, as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a clan still haunted him. For a moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg, but a glance at him convinced me otherwise.    “After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of Europe—Paris, Venice, Rome—collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago.”    With an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. The very phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that of a turbaned “character” leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a tiger through the Bois de Boulogne.    “Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief, and I tried very hard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life. I accepted a commission as first lieutenant when it began.

We stayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty men with sixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last they found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of dead.

Scott	The Great Gatsby	  “I’m going to make a big request of you to-day,” he said, pocketing his souvenirs with satisfaction, “so I thought you ought to know something about me. I didn’t want you to think I was just some nobody. You see, I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there trying to forget the sad thing that happened to me.” He hesitated. “You’ll hear about it this afternoon.”    “At lunch?”    “No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you’re taking Miss Baker to tea.”    “Do you mean you’re in love with Miss Baker?”    “No, old sport, I’m not. But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak to you about this matter.”    I hadn’t the faintest idea what “this matter” was, but I was more annoyed than interested. I hadn’t asked Jordan to tea in order to discuss Mr. Jay Gatsby. I was sure the request would be something utterly fantastic, and for a moment I was sorry I’d ever set foot upon his overpopulated lawn.    He wouldn’t say another word. His correctness grew on him as we neared the city. We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of red-belted ocean-going ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with the dark, undeserted saloons of the faded-gilt nineteen-hundreds. Then the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had a glimpse of Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting vitality as we went by.

Slowly the white wings of the boat moved against the blue cool limit of the sky. Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and the abounding blessed isles.    “There’s sport for you,” said Tom, nodding. “I’d like to be out there with him for about an hour.”    We had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened too against the heat, and drank down nervous gayety with the cold ale.    “What’ll we do with ourselves this afternoon?” cried Daisy, “and the day after that, and the next thirty years?”    “Don’t be morbid,” Jordan said. “Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall.”    “But it’s so hot,” insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, “and everything’s so confused. Let’s all go to town!”    Her voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, molding its senselessness into forms.    “I’ve heard of making a garage out of a stable,” Tom was saying to Gatsby, “but I’m the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage.”    “Who wants to go to town?” demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby’s eyes floated toward her. “Ah,” she cried, “you look so cool.”    Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space. With an effort she glanced down at the table. 
FitzFT.txt	135	2.0	1925	Fitzgerald, F.

That’s why I been bothering you about the car.”    “What do I owe you?”    “Dollar twenty.”    The relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had a bad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions hadn’t alighted on Tom. He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in another world, and the shock had made him physically sick. I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour before—and it occurred to me that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well. Wilson was so sick that he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty—as if he just got some poor girl with child.    “I’ll let you have that car,” said Tom. “I’ll send it over tomorrow afternoon.”    That locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of something behind. Over the ashheaps the giant eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their vigil, but I perceived, after a moment, that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twenty feet away. 
FitzFT.txt	145	2.0	1925	Fitzgerald, F. Scott	The Great Gatsby	  “Even that’s a lie,” said Tom savagely. “She didn’t know you were alive. Why—there’re things between Daisy and me that you’ll never know, things that neither of us can ever forget.”    The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.    “I want to speak to Daisy alone,” he insisted. “She’s all excited now——”    “Even alone I can’t say I never loved Tom,” she admitted in a pitiful voice. “It wouldn’t be true.”    “Of course it wouldn’t,” agreed Tom.    She turned to her husband.    “As if it mattered to you,” she said.    “Of course it matters. I’m going to take better care of you from now on.”    “You don’t understand,” said Gatsby, with a touch of panic. “You’re not going to take care of her any more.”    “I’m not?” Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He could afford to control himself now. “Why’s that?”    “Daisy’s leaving you.”    “Nonsense.”    “I am, though,” she said with a visible effort.    “She’s not leaving me!” Tom’s words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby. “Certainly not for a common swindler who’d have to steal the ring he put on her finger.”    “I won’t stand this!” cried Daisy. “Oh, please let’s get out.”    “Who are you, anyhow?” broke out Tom. “You’re one of that bunch that hangs around with Meyer Wolfsheim—that much I happen to know. I’ve made a little investigation into your affairs—and I’ll carry it further to-morrow.”    “You can suit yourself about that, old sport,” said Gatsby steadily. 
FitzFT.txt	181	180.0	1925	Fitzgerald, F. Scott	The Great Gatsby	  Dear Mr. Carraway. This has been one of the most terrible shocks of my life to me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all. Such a mad act as that man did should make us all think. I cannot come down now as I am tied up in some very important business and cannot get mixed up in this thing now. If there is anything I can do a little later let me know in a letter by Edgar. I hardly know where I am when I hear about a thing like this and am completely knocked down and out.    Yours truly    MEYER WOLFSHEIM    and then hasty addenda beneath:    Let me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all.    When the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago was calling I thought this would be Daisy at last. But the connection came through as a man’s voice, very thin and far away.    “This is Slagle speaking . . .”    “Yes?” The name was unfamiliar.    “Hell of a note, isn’t it? Get my wire?”    “There haven’t been any wires.”    “Young Parke’s in trouble,” he said rapidly. “They picked him up when he handed the bonds over the counter. They got a circular from New York giving ’em the numbers just five minutes before. What d’you know about that, hey? You never can tell in these hick towns——”    “Hello!” I interrupted breathlessly. “Look here—this isn’t Mr. Gatsby. Mr. Gatsby’s dead.”    There was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an exclamation . . . then a quick squawk as the connection was broken.

Scott	The Great Gatsby	  I spent my Saturday nights in New York, because those gleaming, dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still hear the music and the laughter, faint and incessant, from his garden, and the cars going up and down his drive. One night I did hear a material car there, and saw its lights stop at his front steps. But I didn’t investigate. Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the ends of the earth and didn’t know that the party was over.    On the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer, I went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once more. On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight, and I erased it, drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down to the beach and sprawled out on the sand.    Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound. And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors’ eyes—a fresh, green breast of the new world. Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby’s house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an æsthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder. 
FitzFT.txt	198	1051200.0	1925	Fitzgerald, F. Scott	The Great Gatsby	  And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy’s dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.    Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter—to-morrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And one fine morning——    So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.     
ScotWI.txt	0	5256000.0	1819	Scott, Walter	Ivanhoe	IVANHOE.  CHAPTER I.    IN that pleasant district of merry England which  is watered by the river Don, there extended in ancient  times a large forest, covering the greater part  fo the beautiful hills and valleys which lie between  Sheffield and the pleasant town of Doncaster. The  remains of this extensive wood are still to be seen at  the noble seats of Wentworth, of Warndiffe Park,  and around Rotherham. Here haunted of yore the  fabulousDragon of Wantley; here were fought many  of the most desperate battles during the civil wars of  the Roses; and here also flourished in ancient times  those bands, of gallant outlaws, whose deeds have  been rendered so popular in English song.  Such being our chief scene, the date of our story  jtefers to a period towards the end of the reign of  Richard I., when his return from his long captivity  had become an event rather wished than hoped for  by his despairing subjects, who were in the meantime  subjected to every species of subordinate oppression.  The nobles, whose power had become ex  *3  22 IVANHOE.  orbitant during the reign of Stephen, and whom the  prudence of Henry the Second had scarce reduced  into some degree of subjugation to the crown, had  now resumed their ancient licence in its utmost extent;  despising the feeble interference of the English  Council of State, fortifying their castles, increasing  the number of their dependents, reducing all round  thein to a state of vassalage, and striving by every  means in their power, to place themselves each at the  head of such forces as might enable him to make a  figure in the national convulsions which appeared to  be impending. 
ScotWI.txt	1	2628000.0	1819	Scott, Walter	Ivanhoe	The situation of the inferior gentry, or Franklins,  as they were caljed, who, by the law and spirit of the  English constitution, were entitled to hold themselves  independent of feudal tyranny, became now unusually  precarious. If, as was most generally the case,  they placed themselves under the protection of any  of the petty kings in their vicinity, accepted of feudal  offices in his household, or bound themselves, by mutual  treaties of alliance and protection, to support  him in his enterprises, they might indeed purchase  temporary repose; but it must be with the sacrifice  of that independence which was so dear to every  English bosom, and at the certain hazard of being  involved as a party in whatever rash expedition the  ambition of their protector might lead him to undertake.  On the other hand, such and so multiplied  were the means of vexation and oppression possessed  by the great Barons, that they never wanted the pretext,  and seldom the will, to harass and pursue, even  to the very edge of destruction, any of their less  powerful neighbours, who attempted to separate themselves  from their authority, and to trust for their protection,  during the dangers of the times, to their own  inoffensive conduct, and to the laws of the land. 
ScotWI.txt	105	10.0	1819	Scott, Walter	Ivanhoe	Emboldened by these considerations, the Jew pursued  his point, and jostled the Norman Christian,  without respect either to his descent, quality, or religion.  The complaints of the old man, however,  excited the indignation of the by standers. One of  these, a stout well set yeoman, arrayed in Lincoln  green, having twelve arrows in his belt, with a baldric  and badge of silver, and a bow of six feet length  in his hand, turned short round, and while his countenance,  which constant exposure to weather had  rendered brown as a hazel nut, grew darker with anger,  he advised the Jew to remember that all the  wealth he had acquired by sucking the blood of his  IVANHOE.. 103  miserable victims had but swelled him like a bottled  spider, which might be overlooked while he kept in  a corner but would be crushed if it ventured into the  light. This intimation, delivered in Norman english  with a firm voice and a stern aspect, made the Jew  shrink back, and he would have probably withdrawn  himself altogether from a vicinity so dangerous, had  not the attention of every one been called to the sudden  entrance of Prince John, who at that moment entered  the lists, attended by a numerous and gay train,  consisting partly of laymen, partly of churchmen, as  light in their dress, and as gay in their demeanour  as their companions. Among the latter was the Prior  of Jorvaulx, in the most gallant trim which a dignitary  of the church could exhibit. Fur and gold was not  spared in his garments; and the points of his boots,  outheroding the preposterous fashion'of the time turned  up so very far, as to be attached, not to his knees  merely, but to his very girdle, and effectually prevented  him from putting his foot into the stirrup. 
ScotWI.txt	111	0.2499	1819	Scott, Walter	Ivanhoe	But with the blood of this ancient royal race, many  of their infirmities had descended to Athelstane. He  was comely in countenance, bulky and strong in person,  and in the flower of his age — yet inanimate in  expression, dull eyed, heavy browed, inactive and  sluggish in all his motions, and so slow in resolution,  that the soubriquet of one of his ancestors was conferred  upon him, and he was very generally called  Athelstane the Unready. His friends, and he had  many, who as well as Cedric, were passionately attached  to him, contented that this sluggish temper  arose not from want of courage, but from mere want  of decision; others alleged that this hereditary vice  of drunkenness had obscured his faculties, never of  a very acute order, and that the passive courage and  meek good nature which remained behind, were  merely the dregs of a temper that might have been  valuable, but of which, all the valuable parts had  flown oflfin the progress of a long course of brutal debauchery.    It was to this person, such as we have described  him, that the Prince addressed his imperious command  to make place for Isaac and Rebecca. Athel  stane, utterly confounded at an order which the  manners and feelings of the times held so injuriously  insulting, unwilling to obey, yet undetermined how  1 08 IVANHOE.

To suffer the Jew to pay himself wouldbe  dishonest, for it would be cheating my master; and  unreasonable, for it were the part 61' a fool; and unchristian,  since it would be plundering a believer to  enrich an infidel."  " See him contented, however, thbu varlet, " said  the Disinherited Knight.  " I will do so, " said Gurth, taking the bag under  his cloak, and leaving the apartment; '' and it will go  hard, " he muttered, " but I content him with one fourth  of his own asking." So saying, he departed,  and left the Disinherited Knight to his own perplexed  ruminations; which upon more accounts than it  is now possible to communicate to the reader, were  of a nature peculiarly agitating and painful.  We must now change the scene to the village of  A^hby, or rather to a country house in its vicinity  belonging to a wealthy Israelite, with whom Isaac,  his daughter, and retinue, had taken up their quarters;  the Jews, it is well known, being as liberal in  exercising the duties of hospitality and charity among  their own people, as they were alleged to be reluctant,  and churlish in extending them to others. 
ScotWI.txt	183	2.0	1819	Scott, Walter	Ivanhoe	The consequences of the encounter were not instantly  seen, for the dust raised by the trampling ot  so many steeds darkened the air, and it was a minute  ere the anxious spectators could see the fate of  the encounter. When the fight became visible, half  the knights on each side were dismounted, some by  the dexterity of their adversary's lance, — some by the  superior weight, which had broke down both horse  and man, — some lay stretched on earth as if never  more to rise — some had already gained their feet, and  were closing hand to hand with those of the enemy  who were in the same predicament — and two or three,  who had received wounds by which they were disabled,  were stopping their blood by their scarfs, and  endeavouring to extricate themselves from the tumult.  The mounted knights, whose lances had been almost  all broken by the fury of the encounter, were now  closely engaged with their swords, shouting their war  cries, and exchanging buffets, as' if honour and life  depended on the issue of the combat.  The tumult was presently increased by the advance  of the second rank on either side, which acting  as a reserve, now rushed on to aid their companions.  The followers of Brian de Bois guilbert  shouted — " He! beau seant! beau seant'.* — for the  Temple — for the Temple." The opposite party  * jbeau teant was the name of the Templar's banner, which vas  half black, half white, to intimate, it is said, that they were candid  and fair towards Christians, but black and terrible towards infidels.

" Nevertheless, were I as thou, " said the knight  " I would take my walk by moonlight, when foresters  and keepers are warm in bed, and ever and anon,  — as I pattered my prayers, — I would let fly a shaft  among the herds of dun deer that feed in the glades —  Resolve me Holy Clerk, hast thou never practised  such a pastime?"

" How little he knows this bosom, " she said, " to  imagine that cowardice or meanness of soul must  needs be its guests, because I have censured the fantastic  chivalry of the Nazarenes! Would to heaven  that the shedding of mine own blood, drop by drop,  could redeem the captivity of Judah!

''It is better, " he said, " than my fondest hope  could have anticipated; either my wound has been  slighter than the effusion of blood led me to suppose,  or this balsam has wrought a wonderful cure  upon it.

" Nor would I desire to leave your hospitable roof,  venerable father, " said Ivanhoe, " did I not feel myself  able to endure the journey, and compelled to undertake  it."

Upon the present occasion, a throne was erected at  the eastern end for the Grandmaster, surrounded  with seats of distinction for the Preceptors and  Knight's of the Order. Over these floated the sacred  standard, called Le Beau seant, which was the ensign,  as its name was the battle cry, of the Templars.  At the opposite end of the lists was a pile of faggots,  so arranged around a stake, deeply fixed in the  ground, as to leave a space for the victim whom they  were destined to consume, to enter within the fatal  circle, in order to be chained to the stake by the fetters  which hung ready for that purpose. Besides this  deadly apparatus stood four black slaves, whose colour  and African features then so little known in  England, appalled the multitude, who gazed on them  as on demons employed about their own diabolical  exercises.

" O, remain with us — the counsel of holy  men will wean you from your unhappy law, and I  will be a sister to you."  " No lady, " answered Rebecca, the same calm  melancholy reigning in her soft voice and beautiful  features — '' that may not be. I may not change the  faith of my fathers like a garment unsuited to the  climate in which I seek to dwell, and unhappy, lady,  I will not be. He, to whom I dedicate my future  life, will be my comforter, if I do His will."  " Have you then convents, to one of which you  mean to retire?" asked Rowena.  " No, lady, " said the Jewess; "but among our  people, since the time of Abraham downward, have  been women who have devoted their thoughts to  Heaven, and their actions to works of kindness to  men, tending the sick, feeding the hungry, and' relieving  the distressed. Among these will Rebecca  be numbered. Say this to thy lord, should he inquire  after the late of her whose life he saved."  There was an involuntary tremor in Rebecca's  voice, and a tenderness of accent, which perhaps betrayed  more than she would willingly have expressed.  She hastened to bid Rowena adieu.  " Farewell, " she said. May He, who made both  Jew and Christian, shower down on you his choicest  IVANHOE. 309    blessings! The bark that wafts us hence will be under  weigh ere we can reach the port."

The  fair Saxon related the singular conference to her husband,  on whose mind it made a deep impression. He  lived long and happily with Rowena, for they were  attached to each other by the bonds of early affection,  and they loved each other the more, from recollection  of the obstacles.which had impeded their union. Yet  it would be inquiring too curiously to ask, whether  the recollection of Rebecca's beauty and magnanimity  did not recur to his mind more frequently than the  fair descendant of Alfred might altogether have approved.    Ivanhoe distinguished himself in the service of  Richard, and was graced with farther marks of the  royal favour. He might have risen still higher, but  for the premature death of the heroic Coeur deLioh,  before the Castle of Chaluz, near Limoges. With  the life of a generous, but rash and romantic monarch,  perished all the projects which his ambition  and his generosity had formed; and to him may be  applied, with a slight alteration, the lines composed  by Johnson for Charles of Sweden —  His fate was destined to a foreign strand,  A petty fortress and an " humble" hand;  He left the name at which the world grew pale,  To point a mortal and adorn a TALE.  THE END.    f   
LittRM.txt	0	1.0	1978	Littell, Robert	Mother Russia	CHAPTER 1      Robespierre Pravdin,    pale as death …            Robespierre Pravdin, pale as death, pushes out with the primitively long, broken, badly set thumb of a Cro-Magnon (was he Homo Economicus in some previous incarnation?) the cardboard drawer and salutes the bits of wood lined up like cotton-tipped cartridges in an ammunition box.    Q.    Hyphen.    Tips.    Possibilities flicker before his eyes like frames from an old Eisenstein. (Eyeglasses shatter, the baby carriage hurtles down the steps.) He removes one of the sticks and rolls the thin shaft between his deformed thumb and forefinger. Trembling with excitement, he tilts his head and delicately inserts the tip in his ear, extracts it and peers at the orange-brown wax on the cotton. His bloodless lips move, words form but no sound emerges; he is speechless with admiration. The Q-Tip could revolutionize Russia, he feels it in the marrow of his brittle bones. Handled discreetly, it could do for the Russian proletariat what it did for the American proletariat (what it has done for him): stop them from cleaning their ears with their keys!    And he will be the one who did it! Robespierre Isayevich Pravdin, the man who brought the Q-Tip to Mother Russia. Hero of Socialist Labor! The Order of the Red Star!! The Order of the Red Banner!!! The Order of Lenin even!!!! (Pravdin wears all four already but he didn’t earn them, he found them in the melting snow.) He can almost feel Leonid Ilyich gripping his thin shoulders and pecking like a pigeon at the reddish stubble on each cheek. 
LittRM.txt	1	0.4998	1978	Littell, Robert	Mother Russia	  It’s as plain as the comfortingly long lifeline on his enormous palm: the Q-Tip is an idea whose time has come. Before you can build communism you must construct socialism. Before socialism, an advanced industrial society. And who (the dialogue with himself is becoming animated; he waves the tiny cotton-tipped baton about in the air) ever heard of an advanced industrial society without Q-Tips!    The exquisite logic of it, the scientific inevitability of it, makes Pravdin shudder.    Thesis: hard wood.    Antithesis: soft cotton.    Synthesis: (he shouts it out in a voice raw with lust) “The Q-Tip!”    With her resources Russia could close the Q-Tip gap in a matter of months. If the planet is seven-tenths water, Russia is seven-tenths trees. And in the south, Uzbeki gold; Pravdin saw it with his own eyes when he flew down to Samarkand to pick up some bolts of silk for the wife of the Mexican ambassador and the fermented mare’s milk for the Druse: field upon field piled high with mounds (mounds nothing, mountains!) of cotton. 
LittRM.txt	5	10.0	1978	Littell, Robert	Mother Russia	  Yawning (the result of a late night in the hard currency bar of the Hotel Moskva with two English computer technicians), Pravdin looks at his watches (Japanese, self-winding, they register seconds, minutes, hours, months, fiscal years and diurnal tides in the Philippine Sea) that he wears on top of his cuff because the expanding bands snag the hairs on his wrist. The one set to Moscow time, which has water vapor under the crystal, registers half past. (The other, which has no crystal at all, is set to Greenwich Mean Time; Pravdin feels the need for a standard in his life.) He ransacks the room for his appointment calendar, finds it under a pile of old Reader’s Digests, confirms the luncheon for the East German editors at the Slaviansky Bazaar. (Pravdin never misses an affair at the Slaviansky if he can help it; they serve Polish, not Russian, vodka, and Georgian sausages that are better than sex.) He pulls on his Eisenhower jacket and basketball sneakers, stuffs his briefcase with Swiss watches, Deutsche Grammophon LP’s, American flame-thrower cigarette lighters, Bolshoi tickets, lubricated Swedish condoms, double locks the door of his flat and starts down the wide staircase. The wooden steps creak agreeably under his feet. Count your blessings, Pravdin tells himself in what has become a morning ritual. You’re reasonably healthy, relatively wealthy and you live in the next to last wooden house in central Moscow. Touch wood. (His bony knuckles rap on the polished banister.)    Outside a crowd has gathered around a notice tacked to a tree.
LittRM.txt	14	60.0	1978	Littell, Robert	Mother Russia	  “Dzerzhinsky is twenty-five minutes by metro from the Kremlin,” the woman continues tonelessly. “The flat is in a building with an elevator, it is eighty-five meters from a metro station, it has fourteen square meters surface, heat, hot water and kitchen privileges—”    “I’m entitled to eighteen square meters,” Pravdin whines.    The woman shrugs, writes the address on a card, stamps the card with a seal and signs her name across the seal, hands it to Pravdin, looking up at him for the first time.    “Could I trouble you,” Pravdin says with mock formality, “for the return of my Bolshoi tickets.”    “What tickets,” the thin woman asks innocently, “are you talking about?”      Pravdin paces off the distance from the metro to the front door of the gray building, six stories, one of many in a suburban project set at angles that suggest they are giving each other the cold shoulder. People stare. Pravdin concentrates, loses count, starts again, is annoyed to find the total eighty-three.    The occupants of the flat, a worn, tired man with thinning hair and his pregnant wife, are wrapping dishes in newspaper and packing them in cartons when Pravdin knocks. (A note indicates the bell is out of order.)    “You’re the new tenant then,” the man assumes. He manages a smile. “Come on, I’ll give you the royal tour.”    “First the lowdown on the building,” Pravdin demands. His eyes, darting nervously, take in the room: boxes tied and ready to go, matching overstuffed easy chairs, a grand-father clock with a sweep second hand that jerks when it passes the five, a huge television set, trunks, suitcases. 
LittRM.txt	59	15.0	1978	Littell, Robert	Mother Russia	  The rain lets up and Nadezhda backs away from the tree to photograph Pravdin with her old Leica. On an impulse she kicks off her sandals and scampers up the hill, slipping on the wet grass. Pravdin, picking his way around patches of mud, follows. Half way up they find a bench and sit on plastic bags that Pravdin produces from his briefcase. Nadezhda dips into her net sack and comes up with two oranges. She breaks the skin of hers with her teeth and peels it with her fingers, which are long and delicate. Pravdin fishes a knife from his pocket and attacks his. When the oranges are finished Pravdin throws the peels in a trash basket and Nadezhda takes out some chocolate cake and a carton of milk. She bites off the corner of the carton and drinks in gulps with her head thrown back.    The rain has given way to moist sunshine. Below and to the right some middle-aged women strip to their underwear to take the sun. “I heard once about the wife of one of our diplomats in New York who took off her clothes in a park and sunned herself in her underwear, as our women here do,” Pravdin recounts. “Somehow her picture turned up in a newspaper and there was a great scandal. The Party members at the embassy got together to try her. She pleaded that her underwear were her best clothes—and got off!”    A black cat, its hair slick from the rain, wanders by, pauses to rub against Pravdin’s trouser leg.
LittRM.txt	62	3.0	1978	Littell, Robert	Mother Russia	  Pravdin tries again. “When I came out of the camps, an old man of thirty-one is what I was. I had no skill, no profession; all I had was a notation in my workbook that I had served time, and another notation on my internal passport that I was Jewish. Between the two who would give me a job? Nobody would give me a job is who. So I threw away my workbook and became self-employed. The only way I could live was inside the Jewish cliché—as a hustler on the make. As long as I do what everyone expects me to do, I am left to my own devices. I also have a theory, if you want to know it, that I fulfill a very important function in our socialist paradise. I supply people who have money with something to spend it on.”    “You make yourself sound important,” Nadezhda notes on her pad.    “Important is what I am,” Pravdin says sourly. “I take from the rich and give to me.” And he bends down and scrawls in chalk along the sidewalk under Nadezhda’s feet:    Behind every fortune is a crime    (H. de Balzac: Pravdin once spent two months in solitary with a Balzac nut).    Nadezhda winds the sandal straps around her ankles, ties them, starts walking toward the Metro station.    “Thank you,” she jots on a slip that she offers to Pravdin. 
LittRM.txt	64	45.0	1978	Littell, Robert	Mother Russia	and Pravdin. He studies the position for a long moment with a baffled expression. Suddenly his eyes surge open as he spots the flaw in his opponent’s game. “But you haven’t done your homework,” he taunts. “Fischer tried pawn queen five in a queen’s gambit declined in fifty-nine and lost eighteen moves later!”    “That’s new,” Friedemann T. comments loudly. “He’s accepting an isolated pawn in return for a king’s side attack.”    “The poisoned pawn variation of the Najdorf defense is Zaitsev’s specialty,” Pravdin notes. He takes another bite of toast and caviar, sips champagne, adds:    “The offered pawn is what he always accepts.”    “I don’t really like caviar,” Friedemann T. admits on their way out of the chess club. “I don’t appreciate all those little explosions in my mouth.”    “I don’t mind the caviar,” Pravdin confesses, “but vodka I prefer to champagne any day. A headache is what champagne always gives me.”    Friedemann T. pauses to look in a department store window. “I don’t mean to alarm you,” he says quietly, “but one of us is being followed.”    “What followed?” Pravdin cries nervously. “Where followed?”    “The tall man in the blue raincoat at the kiosk. We’ll split up at the corner and see which one of us is the pigeon.”    They separate, walking off in different directions. When they are half a block apart Friedemann T.
LittRM.txt	78	5.0	1978	Littell, Robert	Mother Russia	Stalin: Pravdin has read it and wept). The giant doors of the KGB building yawn open; the Druse, holding a guest list, bars the way. Blood trickles from his severed jugular. “Pravdin, R. I.,” Pravdin calls out, “at your beck and call.” The Druse shakes his head without looking at the list. “There is no Pravdin, R. I.,” he says politely. A bird perches on Pravdin’s head, squawks, “Rev-lutions are verbose, waak, waak.” “There is no Trotsky, L. D., either,” insists the Druse. Pravdin flashes the crooked smile that signals he is about to gate-crash, digs his spurs into the side of the beast he is afraid to identify. It rears back, empties its bowels with a spasmodic heave of its sphincter muscle. The aroma, reminiscent of sour mustard, burns Pravdin’s nostrils, stings his eyes. He panics, fumbles frantically for his gas mask, comes up with only a handful of brittle pages bound in ribbons.    “Aiiiiiiiii!” screams Pravdin, bolting upright in bed, sweaty and weak and wide awake.    “Robespierre Isayevich,” Mother Russia calls up from the bottom of the stairs leading to the attic. “Pssssssst, Robespierre Isayevich, are you, God forbid, ill?”    “Bad dreams,” Pravdin responds, mopping the sweat on his forehead with his pajama sleeve.    “Come down then,” Zoya orders. “I couldn’t unfortunately sleep either. I’m brewing up a pot that will put the both of us out of our misery.”    Pravdin folds an old robe around his bones, slips his feet into his sneakers without bothering to tie the laces, descends to the kitchen. Zoya, wearing an Uzbek robe and her fox furs, places two steaming cups on the table. 
LittRM.txt	88	1.5	1978	Littell, Robert	Mother Russia	  “Let me begin by offering you my personal congratulations,” Pravdin ventures.    The young prosecutor is startled. “Why?”    “The promotion is why,” Pravdin explains. “Not to mention the transfer. Before Moscow where were you posted?”    “I was in Alma Ata,” the prosecutor acknowledges. His face has reddened. “But how do you know these things?”    “I have friends in high places.” Pravdin winks. “I could use influence, but I don’t take advantage of my name. I wait my turn like any ordinary citizen. When my number is called I present my body, scarred in defense of the Motherland, exactly as if I were a nobody.”    “It is only fair to tell you,” the prosecutor informs Pravdin gravely, “that I am not impressed with physical scars.”    “Mental scars then,” Pravdin clutches at a straw. He lowers his voice, gestures to the walls to indicate they have ears. “When I was thirteen I was picked up for writing antifascist slogans on the Kremlin walls. I chose the wrong moment; Papa Stalin had just signed on the dotted line alongside von Ribbentrop. I was accused of premature antifascism and packed off to a Komsomol camp, where the big problem was premature ejaculation. Mental scars, friend, are what I have more than my share of.”    “Am I to assume that you are a member of the Party?” the Prosecutor inquires. 
LittRM.txt	119	32.0	1978	Littell, Robert	Mother Russia	“I’m a modest man, maestro, content to store up credit in high places. When you can do me a favor you will know it without my asking.”    The Poet rises from the swivel chair suddenly, motions for his visitor to stay where he is, disappears from the study. Pravdin hears a hurried, hushed conversation with the housekeeper, a phone being lifted from its cradle, a door closing, then stillness. He waits five minutes, ten, a quarter of an hour, fidgets with the medals on his Eisenhower jacket, paces. Half an hour goes by and no Poet. Pravdin pokes his head out of the study, spies the housekeeper, her thick arms folded across her breasts, mounting guard on the front door.    “Where, ravishing lady, has our Poet gone to?”    “What Poet?” demands the housekeeper.    “What Poet is a funny question,” Pravdin says. He whistles between his teeth, shakes his head. “The Poet,” he says when the housekeeper makes no reply. “The Poet who sleeps, eats, masturbates, defecates within the wallpapered walls of this faded palace.”    “I told you when you forced your way in,” the housekeeper says sternly, “he has been on the Black Sea these past two weeks. A mud cure. Maybe now you will believe me.”      The man in the blue raincoat and the flat short-brimmed fedora, along with two others in identical raincoats (but bareheaded; Pravdin claims to discern a hierarchy based on whether plainclothes police wear hats) are waiting outside the Poet’s apartment building. As Pravdin appears they spring into life. Their movements are precise, choreographed even: one opens the rear door of a black Moskvitch parked at the curb; the other two arrange themselves on either side of Pravdin as if they are parentheses. “You are obliged to come with us,” the man with the fedora instructs him. 
LittRM.txt	120	1.0	1978	Littell, Robert	Mother Russia	  Pravdin’s bloodless lips move, words form but no sound emerges; he is speechless with fear. His tongue goes bone dry, his bowels churn; he passes gas. A neck muscle, then an eyelid, twitches. Infirmities spread through his body like a rash; no sooner has he suppressed one twitch than another pops out. The only proper attitude, it occurs to Pravdin, is panic. Accordingly, his brain loses contact with his knees; his briefcase slips out of his hand; his thin body starts to sag at the joints. The men on either side, experienced in such matters, retrieve the briefcase, catch Pravdin under the armpits and funnel him toward the car.    Pravdin twists his head so that he can see over his shoulder, spots the Poet watching from a fourth-floor window. “Oy, where come with you?” he cries, suddenly finding his voice. “Why come with you?” He tries to catch the eye of a woman pushing a baby carriage, but she walks past as if the little group doesn’t exist. “When come with you?” Pravdin croaks, ducking his head and climbing into the back seat. The two blue raincoats pile in after him. “Who are the you I’m supposed to come with?” he whimpers as the door slams shut and the car lurches forward. 
LittRM.txt	122	10.0	1978	Littell, Robert	Mother Russia	  “Strip,” orders a husky attendant. “Clothing on the table, folded.”    Under the watchful eyes of the attendant Pravdin unties the laces on his sneakers, pulls them off, then the socks, strips to the skin and folds his Eisenhower jacket and trousers and shirt and underwear on the table. In the neon-bright light his pale skin takes on a sickly yellowish tint. Veins throb in his thin arms. An eye twitches. His head aches. Pravdin brings a hand in a clawing motion to his forehead, presses his damp palm to his clammy skin.    “Bend over, spread your cheeks,” orders the attendant. He systematically searches the various openings in Pravdin’s body, checks between the toes and behind the ears, runs a fine tooth comb through the wild red hair on his head and the tangled spirally hair on his pubis. Satisfied that Pravdin is hiding nothing, he turns to his clothing and goes over every garment centimeter by centimeter. When he finishes he returns everything except the shoelaces and the belt, indicates with a wave of his hand that Pravdin is to dress, leads him into another room that looks like a doctor’s waiting room. There are several old chairs with worn fabric, a pile of Polish magazines on a low table, a window with a wire mesh grille on the outside overlooking Dzerzhinsky Square and the Detsky Mir, a toy emporium across the way. The glass on the window is thick, the window is screwed shut, and the sounds of the traffic are very faint, almost as if they originate in Pravdin’s memory. 
LittRM.txt	216	4.0	1978	Littell, Robert	Mother Russia	  Pravdin is incredulous. “Anytime you want is when you can pee?”    His roommate nods, regards Pravdin as if he is off his rocker. Pravdin takes himself down to the second door on his right in the hallway, opens his fly, pees into a toilet bowl with water in it, luxuriates in the sound of water spilling into water, glances at himself in the mirror over the sink when he washes his hands, turns quickly away when he sees someone he doesn’t recognize. He is thinner, paler, bloodless almost, it seems to him; his cheeks are sunken, his eyes lost in the shadowy depths of hollows.    “What’s the lowdown on the building?” Pravdin inquires when he returns to his room.    Abalakin has drawn up a chair in front of the open window and is sitting on it stark naked, sunning his hairy chest. “It’s a sane crowd, generally speaking,” he says, making no effort to conceal his bitterness. “On the side nearest the W.C. is a stress engineer who wrote a letter to the United Nations complaining about the lack of Soviet assistance to the struggle against imperialism in Vietnam. His roommate is an astronomer who published a report on black holes; it turns out that black holes are antisocialist. This same astronomer once discovered a comet and it was named after him. It recently whizzed past the earth a mere three hundred thousand light-years away. We celebrated the occasion by shaking up a bottle of water until it was bubbly and toasting his sanity.
LittRM.txt	226	56160.0	1978	Littell, Robert	Mother Russia	In my naiveté I assumed I could simply present my aging though still angular body at the door of the United States of America Embassy here and give to one of those prissily correct gray-suited assistant something-or-others rubles which he could then convert through some obscure bookkeeping process into dollars which could then be passed on to you. Well we all have (isn’t it so?) our illusions. My favorite to which I am forever faithful is that there is a logic or more precisely an order to the world when all of our senses Eve shout at us that the world or the little we know of it suffers from an essential lack of harmony, an ugly dissonance, a seductive vulgarity, almost as if the music of the spheres were a concerto for vacuum cleaner and orchestra with an occasional solo (do you at all see what I mean?) by one of your darling Singers. Enormous stretches of time and space conspire to rob life of its harmony and (as one thing leads more often than not to another) its meaning and dignity. I have a feeling which is threatening to become a theory that we must make great efforts to End dignity and meaning and let’s not forget harmony in the details of daily life, which is why I suggested in my first zinger dear Mister Singer that your darling little stitching machine takes something away from us in return for permitting us to sew more rapidly.
LittRM.txt	245	20160.0	1978	Littell, Robert	Mother Russia	On his way back here the attic spotted by chance in a pharmacy window a new product called the cotton toothpick, which turns out to be the very same Q-Tips I told you about (do you remember?) some letters back. It seems they are quite poor specimens inasmuch as there is not enough cotton at the points, which are in any case dangerously sharp. A thousand applications is what the publicity boasted, but there was one they never imagined in their wildest moments. The attic (poor dear) was very agitated, he kept asking how can you prove a truth with a nontruth? and writing that there were some things in the world which he couldn’t bear to hear. Right there in front of my eyes (do you have a strong stomach, Mister Singer?) he punctured his ear drums with the sharp tips of the cotton toothpicks. First one, then the other. He didn’t bleed very much you’ll be relieved to know, but it was extremely painful and he did make himself deaf, which has a certain symmetry because the only one in the world he really wants to hear isn’t able to speak. The newfound deafness drove him into a depression from which he seems (thanks God) to be finally emerging, though he still doesn’t touch wood. He has started learning to lip-read and only yesterday, smiling in a way I had never seen him smile before, he handed me a note saying something about how if Q-Tips come can vaginal deodorant spray be far behind.
LittRM.txt	246	525600.0	1978	Littell, Robert	Mother Russia	Trusting you too, dear Mister Singer, will be a victim in your next incarnation I remain    Mother Russia      Post Scriptum: It dawns on me I never told you very much (come to think of it anything) about the house in which I live. It is the (excuse the expression) cul of an L-shaped cul-de-sac. The structure as far as I can judge through my bifocals has no straight lines, no sharp edges, only worn angles and soft sexy shadows. The windows, some of which have eucalyptus branches on the sills stare out at the alleyway like bruised eyes, which is not unreasonable considering the house has seen more than most. In winter it leans into the winds that cut through the cul-de-sac. In summer it leans into winds that aren’t blowing. Inside it smells of sandalwood and peeling wallpaper and fireplaces that don’t draw. I mustn’t forget to mention the Boors creak under foot. The stairs too. I am moved to tell you all this because in one of the silences between sentences (ha! you see I am not all talk!) the sound of hammering reached my ears. Naturally I went down to see what was going on. Everyone who lives in the house was milling excitedly around a piece of paper that had just been tacked to a tree. My attic angrily scrawled across it, Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? What language is that, Jewish? asked a pretty young thing called Ophelia Long Legs. The paper served notice that the bosses who deal with such things have decided to tear down the last wooden house in central Moscow. To construct an enormous high-rise asylum. But that’s another story.    Or is it?
SwifJGT.txt	0	26280000.0	1726	Swift, Jonathan, 1667-1745	Gulliver's Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World	THE PUBLISHER TO THE READER.    The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient and  intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us on the  mother’s side. About three years ago, Mr. Gulliver growing weary of the  concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff, made a  small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark, in  Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet in  good esteem among his neighbours.    Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his father  dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from Oxfordshire; to  confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at Banbury in that  county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.    Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following papers in  my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should think fit. I  have carefully perused them three times. The style is very plain and  simple; and the only fault I find is, that the author, after the manner  of travellers, is a little too circumstantial. There is an air of truth  apparent through the whole; and indeed the author was so distinguished  for his veracity, that it became a sort of proverb among his neighbours  at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing, to say, it was as true as if  Mr. Gulliver had spoken it. 
SwifJGT.txt	1	1576800.0	1726	Swift, Jonathan, 1667-1745	Gulliver's Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World	  By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the author’s  permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to send them into  the world, hoping they may be, at least for some time, a better  entertainment to our young noblemen, than the common scribbles of  politics and party.    This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not made  bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and tides,  as well as to the variations and bearings in the several voyages,  together with the minute descriptions of the management of the ship in  storms, in the style of sailors; likewise the account of longitudes and  latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend, that Mr. Gulliver may be a  little dissatisfied. But I was resolved to fit the work as much as  possible to the general capacity of readers. However, if my own  ignorance in sea affairs shall have led me to commit some mistakes, I  alone am answerable for them. And if any traveller hath a curiosity to  see the whole work at large, as it came from the hands of the author, I  will be ready to gratify him.    As for any further particulars relating to the author, the reader will  receive satisfaction from the first pages of the book.    RICHARD SYMPSON.

The queen buys him of his master the  farmer, and presents him to the king. He disputes with his majesty’s  great scholars. An apartment at court provided for the author. He is in  high favour with the queen. He stands up for the honour of his own  country. His quarrels with the queen’s dwarf.    The frequent labours I underwent every day, made, in a few weeks, a very  considerable change in my health: the more my master got by me, the more  insatiable he grew. I had quite lost my stomach, and was almost reduced  to a skeleton. The farmer observed it, and concluding I must soon die,  resolved to make as good a hand of me as he could. While he was thus  reasoning and resolving with himself, a _sardral_, or gentleman-usher,  came from court, commanding my master to carry me immediately thither for  the diversion of the queen and her ladies. Some of the latter had  already been to see me, and reported strange things of my beauty,  behaviour, and good sense. Her majesty, and those who attended her, were  beyond measure delighted with my demeanour. I fell on my knees, and  begged the honour of kissing her imperial foot; but this gracious  princess held out her little finger towards me, after I was set on the  table, which I embraced in both my arms, and put the tip of it with the  utmost respect to my lip.

But further to  confirm all I had said, I entreated him to give order that my cabinet  should be brought, of which I had the key in my pocket; for he had  already informed me how the seamen disposed of my closet. I opened it in  his own presence, and showed him the small collection of rarities I made  in the country from which I had been so strangely delivered. There was  the comb I had contrived out of the stumps of the king’s beard, and  another of the same materials, but fixed into a paring of her majesty’s  thumb-nail, which served for the back. There was a collection of needles  and pins, from a foot to half a yard long; four wasp stings, like  joiner’s tacks; some combings of the queen’s hair; a gold ring, which one  day she made me a present of, in a most obliging manner, taking it from  her little finger, and throwing it over my head like a collar. I desired  the captain would please to accept this ring in return for his  civilities; which he absolutely refused. I showed him a corn that I had  cut off with my own hand, from a maid of honour’s toe; it was about the  bigness of Kentish pippin, and grown so hard, that when I returned  England, I got it hollowed into a cup, and set in silver. Lastly, I  desired him to see the breeches I had then on, which were made of a  mouse’s skin. 
SwifJGT.txt	208	1440.0	1726	Swift, Jonathan, 1667-1745	Gulliver's Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World	  As I was on the road, observing the littleness of the houses, the trees,  the cattle, and the people, I began to think myself in Lilliput. I was  afraid of trampling on every traveller I met, and often called aloud to  have them stand out of the way, so that I had like to have gotten one or  two broken heads for my impertinence.    When I came to my own house, for which I was forced to inquire, one of  the servants opening the door, I bent down to go in, (like a goose under  a gate,) for fear of striking my head. My wife run out to embrace me,  but I stooped lower than her knees, thinking she could otherwise never be  able to reach my mouth. My daughter kneeled to ask my blessing, but I  could not see her till she arose, having been so long used to stand with  my head and eyes erect to above sixty feet; and then I went to take her  up with one hand by the waist. I looked down upon the servants, and one  or two friends who were in the house, as if they had been pigmies and I a  giant. I told my wife, “she had been too thrifty, for I found she had  starved herself and her daughter to nothing.” In short, I behaved myself  so unaccountably, that they were all of the captain’s opinion when he  first saw me, and concluded I had lost my wits. This I mention as an  instance of the great power of habit and prejudice.

Upon the tenth day we were chased by two pirates, who soon  overtook us; for my sloop was so deep laden, that she sailed very slow,  neither were we in a condition to defend ourselves.    We were boarded about the same time by both the pirates, who entered  furiously at the head of their men; but finding us all prostrate upon our  faces (for so I gave order), they pinioned us with strong ropes, and  setting guard upon us, went to search the sloop.    I observed among them a Dutchman, who seemed to be of some authority,  though he was not commander of either ship. He knew us by our  countenances to be Englishmen, and jabbering to us in his own language,  swore we should be tied back to back and thrown into the sea. I spoken  Dutch tolerably well; I told him who we were, and begged him, in  consideration of our being Christians and Protestants, of neighbouring  countries in strict alliance, that he would move the captains to take  some pity on us. This inflamed his rage; he repeated his threatenings,  and turning to his companions, spoke with great vehemence in the Japanese  language, as I suppose, often using the word _Christianos_.

I then put myself in the most supplicating  posture, and spoke in the humblest accent, but received no answer. Those  who stood nearest over against me, seemed to be persons of distinction,  as I supposed by their habit. They conferred earnestly with each other,  looking often upon me. At length one of them called out in a clear,  polite, smooth dialect, not unlike in sound to the Italian: and therefore  I returned an answer in that language, hoping at least that the cadence  might be more agreeable to his ears. Although neither of us understood  the other, yet my meaning was easily known, for the people saw the  distress I was in.    They made signs for me to come down from the rock, and go towards the  shore, which I accordingly did; and the flying island being raised to a  convenient height, the verge directly over me, a chain was let down from  the lowest gallery, with a seat fastened to the bottom, to which I fixed  myself, and was drawn up by pulleys.

But what I chiefly admired, and thought altogether  unaccountable, was the strong disposition I observed in them towards news  and politics, perpetually inquiring into public affairs, giving their  judgments in matters of state, and passionately disputing every inch of a  party opinion. I have indeed observed the same disposition among most of  the mathematicians I have known in Europe, although I could never  discover the least analogy between the two sciences; unless those people  suppose, that because the smallest circle has as many degrees as the  largest, therefore the regulation and management of the world require no  more abilities than the handling and turning of a globe; but I rather  take this quality to spring from a very common infirmity of human nature,  inclining us to be most curious and conceited in matters where we have  least concern, and for which we are least adapted by study or nature.

The  place is stored with great variety of sextants, quadrants, telescopes,  astrolabes, and other astronomical instruments. But the greatest  curiosity, upon which the fate of the island depends, is a loadstone of a  prodigious size, in shape resembling a weaver’s shuttle. It is in length  six yards, and in the thickest part at least three yards over. This  magnet is sustained by a very strong axle of adamant passing through its  middle, upon which it plays, and is poised so exactly that the weakest  hand can turn it. It is hooped round with a hollow cylinder of adamant,  four feet yards in diameter, placed horizontally, and supported by eight  adamantine feet, each six yards high. In the middle of the concave side,  there is a groove twelve inches deep, in which the extremities of the  axle are lodged, and turned round as there is occasion.    The stone cannot be removed from its place by any force, because the hoop  and its feet are one continued piece with that body of adamant which  constitutes the bottom of the island.

To remedy which, there was a sort of people bred up among us  in the profession, or pretence, of curing the sick. And because I had  some skill in the faculty, I would, in gratitude to his honour, let him  know the whole mystery and method by which they proceed.

When all was ready, and the day came for my departure, I took leave of my  master and lady and the whole family, my eyes flowing with tears, and my  heart quite sunk with grief. But his honour, out of curiosity, and,  perhaps, (if I may speak without vanity,) partly out of kindness, was  determined to see me in my canoe, and got several of his neighbouring  friends to accompany him. I was forced to wait above an hour for the  tide; and then observing the wind very fortunately bearing toward the  island to which I intended to steer my course, I took a second leave of  my master: but as I was going to prostrate myself to kiss his hoof, he  did me the honour to raise it gently to my mouth. I am not ignorant how  much I have been censured for mentioning this last particular.  Detractors are pleased to think it improbable, that so illustrious a  person should descend to give so great a mark of distinction to a  creature so inferior as I. Neither have I forgotten how apt some  travellers are to boast of extraordinary favours they have received.

At our landing, the captain forced  me to cover myself with his cloak, to prevent the rabble from crowding  about me. I was conveyed to his own house; and at my earnest request he  led me up to the highest room backwards. I conjured him “to conceal from  all persons what I had told him of the _Houyhnhnms_; because the least  hint of such a story would not only draw numbers of people to see me, but  probably put me in danger of being imprisoned, or burnt by the  Inquisition.” The captain persuaded me to accept a suit of clothes newly  made; but I would not suffer the tailor to take my measure; however, Don  Pedro being almost of my size, they fitted me well enough. He accoutred  me with other necessaries, all new, which I aired for twenty-four hours  before I would use them.    The captain had no wife, nor above three servants, none of which were  suffered to attend at meals; and his whole deportment was so obliging,  added to very good human understanding, that I really began to tolerate  his company. He gained so far upon me, that I ventured to look out of  the back window. By degrees I was brought into another room, whence I  peeped into the street, but drew my head back in a fright. In a week’s  time he seduced me down to the door. I found my terror gradually  lessened, but my hatred and contempt seemed to increase. I was at last  bold enough to walk the street in his company, but kept my nose well  stopped with rue, or sometimes with tobacco.

The names of  all which virtues are still retained among us in most languages, and are  to be met with in modern, as well as ancient authors; which I am able to  assert from my own small reading.    But I had another reason, which made me less forward to enlarge his  majesty’s dominions by my discoveries. To say the truth, I had conceived  a few scruples with relation to the distributive justice of princes upon  those occasions. For instance, a crew of pirates are driven by a storm  they know not whither; at length a boy discovers land from the topmast;  they go on shore to rob and plunder, they see a harmless people, are  entertained with kindness; they give the country a new name; they take  formal possession of it for their king; they set up a rotten plank, or a  stone, for a memorial; they murder two or three dozen of the natives,  bring away a couple more, by force, for a sample; return home, and get  their pardon. Here commences a new dominion acquired with a title by  divine right. Ships are sent with the first opportunity; the natives  driven out or destroyed; their princes tortured to discover their gold; a  free license given to all acts of inhumanity and lust, the earth reeking  with the blood of its inhabitants: and this execrable crew of butchers,  employed in so pious an expedition, is a modern colony, sent to convert  and civilize an idolatrous and barbarous people!

I am not in the least provoked at the  sight of a lawyer, a pickpocket, a colonel, a fool, a lord, a gamester, a  politician, a whoremonger, a physician, an evidence, a suborner, an  attorney, a traitor, or the like; this is all according to the due course  of things: but when I behold a lump of deformity and diseases, both in  body and mind, smitten with pride, it immediately breaks all the measures  of my patience; neither shall I be ever able to comprehend how such an  animal, and such a vice, could tally together. The wise and virtuous  _Houyhnhnms_, who abound in all excellences that can adorn a rational  creature, have no name for this vice in their language, which has no  terms to express any thing that is evil, except those whereby they  describe the detestable qualities of their _Yahoos_, among which they  were not able to distinguish this of pride, for want of thoroughly  understanding human nature, as it shows itself in other countries where  that animal presides. But I, who had more experience, could plainly  observe some rudiments of it among the wild _Yahoos_.

I dwell the longer upon this  subject from the desire I have to make the society of an English _Yahoo_  by any means not insupportable; and therefore I here entreat those who  have any tincture of this absurd vice, that they will not presume to come  in my sight.       
Van MF.txt	0	15.0	1920	Van Vorst, Marie	Fairfax and his pride	FAIRFAX AND HIS PRIDE          BOOK I    THE KINSMEN          CHAPTER I      One bitter day in January in the year 1880, when New York was a tranquil  city, a young man stood at the South Ferry waiting for the up-town horse  car. With a few other passengers he had just left the packet which had  arrived in New York harbour that afternoon from New Orleans.    Antony Fairfax was an utter stranger to the North.    In his hand he carried a small hand-bag, and by his side on the snow  rested his single valise. Before him waited a red and yellow tram-car  drawn by lean horses, from whose backs the vapour rose on the frosty  air. Muffled to his ears, the driver beat together his hands in their  leather gloves; the conductor stamped his feet. The traveller climbed  into the car, lifting his big bag after him.    The cold was even more terrible to him than to the conductor and driver.  He had come from the South, where he had left the roses and magnolias in  bloom, and the warmth of the country was in his blood. He dug his feet  into the straw covering the floor of the car, buttoned his coat tight  about his neck, pushed his hands deep in his pockets and sat wondering  at the numbing cold.    This, then, was the North! 
Van MF.txt	1	0.33320000000000005	1920	Van Vorst, Marie	Fairfax and his pride	  He watched with interest the few other passengers board the little car:  two fruit vendors and after them were amiably lifted in great bunches of  bananas. Antony asked himself the question whether this new country  would be friendly to him, what would its spirit be toward him, and as  he asked this question of the cold winter air the city suddenly took  reality and formed for him out of his dreams. Would it be kind or cruel?  The coming days would answer: meanwhile he could wait. Some places, like  some people whom we meet, at once extend to us a hand; there are some  that even seem to offer an embrace. Through the car blew a sudden icy  blast and New York's welcome to Fairfax was keen as a blow. There was an  actual physical affront in this wind that struck him in the face.    Suppose the elements were an indication of what the rest would be? But  no--that was ridiculous! There would be certainly warm interiors behind  the snow-fretted panes of the windows in the houses that lined the  streets on either side. There would be warm and cordial hearts to  welcome him somewhere. There would be understanding of heart, indulgence  for youth. He would find open doors for all his ambitions, spurs to his  integrity and effort. He would know how to make use of these ways and  means of progress. For years he had dreamed of the galleries of pictures  and of the museum. It was from this wonderful city whose wideness had  the intense outreach of the unknown that Fairfax had elected to step  into the world. 
Van MF.txt	40	5.0	1920	Van Vorst, Marie	Fairfax and his pride	  "Silly," exclaimed his sister, "she always comes at dinner-time. And we  bet on the cars, Cousin Antony. Now let's say it will be the  seventy-first. We have to put it far away off," she explained, "'cause  we're beginning early."    Fairfax left them, touched by their patience in watching for the mother  bird. He promised to return soon, soon, to go on with his wonderful  tales. As he went downstairs Bella called after him.    "But you didn't say _which_ car you bet on, Cousin Antony."    And Fairfax called back in his Southern drawl: "I reckon she'll come in  a pumpkin chariot." And he heard their delighted giggles as he limped  downstairs.          CHAPTER IX      He avoided his uncle, Mr. Carew, and made up his mind that if the master  of the house were brusque to him, he would not return, were the  threshold worn never so dear by little feet. Bella had the loveliest  little feet a fellow connoisseur of plastic beauty could wish to see,  could wish to watch twinkle in run-down slippers, in scuffled boots--in  boots where a button or two was always lacking--and once when she kicked  off her strap slipper at a lesson Fairfax saw, through a hole in the  stocking, one small perfect toe--a toe of Greek marble perfection, a  most charming, snowy, rosy bit of flesh, and he imagined how adorable  the little foot must be. 
Van MF.txt	225	1.5	1920	Van Vorst, Marie	Fairfax and his pride	  The engineer didn't hear him. He was already thinking how he could  transform his kitchen into a studio, although it had an east light. Just  here Rainsford leaned over and put his hand on Antony's sleeve. "I want  to say a word to you about your wife. I don't think she's very well."    "Molly?" answered his companion calmly. "She's all right. She has a  mighty fine constitution, and I never heard her complain. When did you  see her, Rainsford?" He frowned.    "Saturday, when you were in New York. You forgot to send your pass-book,  and I went for it myself."    "Well?" queried Antony. "What then?"    "Mrs. Fairfax gave me the book, and I stopped to speak with her for a  few moments. I find her very much changed."    The light died from the young man's illumined face where his visions had  kindled a sacred fire. The realities of life blotted it out.    "I'm not able to give Molly any distractions, that you know."    "She doesn't want them, Tony." Rainsford looked kindly and  affectionately, almost tenderly, at him, and repeated gently: "She  doesn't want amusement, Tony."    And Fairfax threw up his head with a sort of despair on his face--    "My God, Rainsford," he murmured, "what can I do?"    "I'm afraid she's breaking her heart," said the older man. "Poor little  woman!" 
Van MF.txt	226	0.4998	1920	Van Vorst, Marie	Fairfax and his pride	        CHAPTER XXVII      In the little room they used as parlour-kitchen and which to one of the  inhabitants at least was lovely, Fairfax found Molly sitting by the  window through which the spring light fell. The evening was warm. Molly  wore a print dress, and in her bodice he saw that she had thrust a spray  of pink geranium from the window-boxes that Antony had made and filled  for her. Nothing that had claim to beauty failed to touch his senses,  and he saw the charm of the picture in the pale spring light. He had  softly turned the door-handle, and as there was a hand-organ playing  without and Molly listening to the music, he entered without her hearing  him.    "Is it yourself?" she exclaimed, startled. "You're home early, Tony."    He told her that he had come to take her for a little walk, and as she  moved out of the light and came toward him, he thought he knew what  Rainsford had meant. She was thin and yet not thin. The roundness had  gone from her cheeks, and there was a mild sadness in her eyes. 
Van MF.txt	229	2.0	1920	Van Vorst, Marie	Fairfax and his pride	  To the agent who had accepted the Fairfax hospitality and come to  supper, Tony said--    "To ease my soul, Peter, I want to tell you of something I did."    Molly had washed the dishes and put them away, and, with a delicate  appreciation of her husband's wish to be alone with his friend, went  into the next room.    "After mother died my old nigger mammy in New Orleans sent me a packet  of little things. I could never open the parcel until the other day.  Amongst the treasures was a diamond ring, Rainsford, one I had seen her  wear when I was a little boy. I took it to a jeweller on Market Street,  and he told me it was worth a thousand dollars."    Here Tony remained silent so long that his companion said--    "That's a lot of money, Tony."    "Well, it came to me," said the young man simply, "like a gift from her.  I asked them to lend me five hundred dollars on it for a year. It seems  that it's a peculiarly fine stone, and they didn't hesitate."    Rainsford was smoking a peaceful pipe, and he held the bowl  affectionately in his hand, his attention fixed on the blond young man  sitting in the full light of the evening. The night was warm, Fairfax  was in snowy shirt-sleeves, his bright hair cropped close revealed the  beautiful lines of his head; he was a powerful man, clean in habits of  body and mind, and his expression as he talked was brilliant and  fascinating, his eyes profound and blue. Around his knees he clasped the  hands that drove an engine and ached to model in plaster and clay. His  big shoe was a deformity, otherwise he was superb. 
Van MF.txt	251	2880.0	1920	Van Vorst, Marie	Fairfax and his pride	She had brought much grace to it and much love. She had given a great  deal. To wait for return, for such gifts, was to wait for the  unattainable.    She went through the open door that she saw open, perhaps not all  unwillingly; and she was not alone, for the child went with her, and  they came to Fairfax and told him that she had gone through gently  murmuring his name.          CHAPTER XXXIV      As Nut Street, with the destruction of his little statue, had been wiped  out of his history, so the two rooms overlooking the river and  steamboats knew Antony Fairfax no more. He turned the key in the door  the day they carried away the body of his wife, and when he came back  from the snowy earth and the snowy white city where he left her with his  hour-old child, he went to the Delavan House as he had done before, and  buried his head in his arms on his lowly bed in a hotel room and wept.    The following day he sent word to Rainsford to look out for another  engineer in his place. He had driven his last trip.    Tito Falutini wrung his friend's hand, and told Fairfax, in his broken  Italian-English, that he knew a fellow would take the rooms as they  stood. "Would Tony give the job to him?" Save for his clothes and  Molly's things, and they were few, he took nothing, not even the  drawings decorating the wall on which other Irish eyes should look with  admiration. 
Van MF.txt	263	2.0	1920	Van Vorst, Marie	Fairfax and his pride	  "Why, why not, Cousin Antony?"    Why not, indeed! He had not prevented Rainsford from sitting there.    "Is the chair weak in its legs?" she laughed. "I'm light--I'll risk it,"  and, half defiantly, she seated herself by the table, leaning both  elbows on it. She looked back at him. "Now, make a little drawing of me  as you used to do. I'll show it to the girls in school to prove what a  genius we have in the family; and I must go back, too, or I'll have more  bad marks than ever."    Fairfax did not obey her. Instead, he looked at her as though he saw  through her to eternity.    Bella sprang up impulsively, and came toward him. "Cousin Antony," she  murmured, "I'm perfectly dreadful. I'm selfish and inconsiderate. It's  only because I'm a little wild. I don't mean it. You've told me  nothing." She lifted his cravat from the chair. "You wear a black cravat  and your clothes are black. Is it for Aunt Arabella still?"    Fairfax seemed to himself to look down on her from a height. Her  brilliance, her sparkle and youth were far away. His heart ached within  him.    "One goes mighty far in five years, Bella.... One loses many things."    "I know--Gardiner and your mother. But who else?"    He saw her face sadden; the young girl extended her hand to him, her  eyes darkened.    "Who else?" she breathed. 
Van MF.txt	286	1.5	1920	Van Vorst, Marie	Fairfax and his pride	  A good-looking young man of twenty-five, not more, with a cheerful,  intelligent face in sober moments, now pale, with parched lips and eyes  not clear yet. He had washed and his hair was smoothly brushed. He had  no regularity of features such as Fairfax, being a well-set-up, ordinary  young fellow, such as one might see in any American college or  university. But there was a fineness in the lines of his mouth, a  drollery and wit in his eyes, and he was thoroughly agreeable.    "I'm from the West," he said, putting his glass down empty. "Robert  Dearborn, from Cincinnati--and I'm no end obliged to you, old chap,  whoever you are. You've got a good breakfast there, haven't you?"    "Have some," Antony offered with real generosity, for he was famished.    "Well," returned Dearborn, "to tell you the truth, I feel as if I were  robbing a sleeping man to take it, for I know how fiendishly hungry you  must be. But, by Jove, I haven't had a thing to eat since"--and he  laughed--"since I was a child."    He rinsed the glass that had held the bromide, poured out some black  coffee for himself and took half of Fairfax's bread and half of his  flower-stamped butter, and devoured it eagerly. When he had finished he  wiped his mouth and genially held out his hand.    "Ever been hungry?"    Antony did not tell him how lately.    "Good," nodded Dearborn, "I understand. Passing through Paris?"    "Just arrived." 
Van MF.txt	303	282240.0	1920	Van Vorst, Marie	Fairfax and his pride	  He limped along the Rue du Bac, his cold hands in his pockets, his head  a little bent. But no battle with life now, be it what it would, could  compare with his battle in New York. Now, indeed, though he was cold and  hungry and tired, he was the inhabitant of a city that he loved, he was  working alone for the art he adored. He believed in himself--not once  had he yet come to the period of artistic despair.    During these seven months the little personal work he had been able to  do had only whetted his desire; he was young, possessed of great talent  and of brilliant imagination, and he was happy and hopeful and  determined; the physical wants did not weigh on his spirit nor did the  long period of labour injure his power of production. He chafed, indeed,  but he felt his strength even as he pulled against the material things  from which he had to free himself.    And as Fairfax, part of the throng, walked aimlessly up the Rue du Bac  with his problems, he walked less alone that night than ever in his  life, for he was absorbed in the thought of the woman. 
Van MF.txt	320	2.5	1920	Van Vorst, Marie	Fairfax and his pride	  "That," said Dearborn with spirit, "is rotten. Now, I will grant you  that, Tony. It's rotten for her. Things have got so mixed up in your  scenario that you cannot frankly go and tell her what a hog he is. That  is what ought to be done, though. She ought to know what kind of a cheat  and poor sort she is going to marry. In real life or drama the simple  thing never happens." Dearborn smiled finely. "She ought to know, but  you can't tell her."    "No," said his friend slowly, "nor would I. But neither can I meet him  in her house or anywhere else. I think I should strike him."    "You didn't strike him, though," said Dearborn, meaningly, "when you had  a good impersonal chance."    "I wish I had."    "I thought you told me they were all going to Rome?"    "Mrs. Faversham doesn't want to go."    "Ah," murmured Dearborn, nodding, "she doesn't."    "No." Fairfax did not seem to observe his friend's tone. "She is  mightily set on having me meet Cedersholm. She wants to have him  patronize me, help me!" He laughed dryly and walked up and down the  studio into the cold, away from the fire, and then back to Dearborn in  his dressing-gown and slippers. "Patronize me, encourage me, pat me on  the back--put me in the way of meeting men of the world of art and  letters, possibly work with him. She has all sorts of kindly patronizing  schemes. But she doesn't know that I have been hungry and cold, and have  been housed and fed by her money. Perhaps she does, though," he cried  furiously to Dearborn. "No doubt she does. Do you think she does, Bob?" 
Van MF.txt	370	1260.0	1920	Van Vorst, Marie	Fairfax and his pride	  He hoped that he should be able to sleep and that the next day would  come quickly. He became ardent and devoted as he dreamed, and all the  way back his heart ached for her.    When he entered the studio and called Dearborn he received no response.  There was a note from the playwright on the table--he would not be  back until the next morning.    Fairfax, his hand under his pillow, crushed her letter, and the words:  "I am yours, Mary," flushed his palm and his cheek.    *    *    *    *    *    He had been awake since dawn, fire in his blood and heart animating his  brain and stimulating his creative power. In the early light he had  seated himself to make a few sketches, drawing little exquisite studies  of her, and the face on the paper was ideal, irritatingly so. The chin  and the cheek was young and soft, too youthful for Mrs. Faversham. It  suggested Bella.    When he went to see her that afternoon, for the first time he was shown  upstairs. Each step was sacred to him as he mounted to the part of the  house in which she lived her intimate life. The stairs were marble,  covered by thick rugs; the iron balustrade had been brought from a  château in the days of the Revolution. Along the wall at his side hung  splendid tapestries, whose colours would have delighted him at another  time. But his eyes now were blinded to material things. His soul, heart  and nature were aflame, and he walked on air. When he was shown into a  small room, Mrs. Faversham's own sitting-room, his agitation was so  great that he seemed to walk through a mist. 
Van MF.txt	381	3.0	1920	Van Vorst, Marie	Fairfax and his pride	  Dearborn greeted her enthusiastically, and Tony stood petrified. The  comtesse, more mistress of the moment than Tony was, put out one hand  and smiled, but she had turned very pale.    It was his Aunt Caroline....    "Mr. Rainsford," she lifted her brows, "I think I have seen you before."    Tony bowed over her hand and Potowski, still smiling and nodding,  cried--    "These are great men and geniuses, _ma chérie_. You have here two great  artists together. They both have wings on their shoulders. Before they  fly away from us and are lost on Olympus, be charming to them. Carolina,  _ma chérie_, they shall hear you sing."    Robert Dearborn put his hand on Potowski's shoulder and said--    "We love your husband, madame. He has been such a bully friend to us,  such a wonderful friend."    "Poof, my dear Bobbie," murmured Potowski.    ("J'ai perdu ma tourterelle.")    Fairfax asked, looking directly at her, "Will you really sing for us,  Madame Potowski? Can you sing some old English ballad? We have not heard  a word of English for many a long day."    Potowski wandered softly into a familiar tune. He smiled over his  shoulder at his wife, and, standing by the piano, Caroline  Carew--Carolina Potowski--put her hands over her husband's on the keys  and indicated an accompaniment, humming.    "If you can, dear, I will sing Mr. Rainsford _this_."    Tony took his place on the divan.    Then Madame Potowski sang:    "Flow gently, sweet Afton." 
Van MF.txt	386	120960.0	1920	Van Vorst, Marie	Fairfax and his pride	  Among his fellow-workers in the Barye studio was the son of a  millionaire pork-packer from Chicago. The young man took a tremendous  liking to Antony. With a certain perspicacity, the rich young fellow  divined much of his new friend's needs. He came to the studio, to their  different reunions, and chummed heartily with Dearborn and Fairfax.  Peterson was singularly lacking in talent and tremendously  over-furnished with heart. One day, as they worked side by side in the  studio of the big man, Peterson watched Antony's handling of a tiger's  head.    "By Jove!" cried the Chicagoan, "you are simply great--you are simply  great! I wonder if you would be furious with me if I said something to  you that is on my mind?"    The something on the simple young man's mind was that he wanted to lend  Fairfax a sum of money, to be paid back when the sculptor saw fit. After  a moment's hesitation Antony accepted the loan, making it one-third as  much as the big-hearted chap had suggested. Fairfax set July as the date  of payment, when his competitive money should come in. He borrowed just  enough to keep him in food and clothes for the following months.    There were no motors in Paris then. In the mornings he drove with Mrs.  Faversham to the Bois and limped by her side in the _allées_, whilst the  worldly people stared at the distinguished, conspicuous couple. One day  Barye himself stopped them, and to the big man Antony presented Mrs. 
Van MF.txt	450	1.0	1920	Van Vorst, Marie	Fairfax and his pride	  She wore a long brown linen painting apron that covered her form,  evidently a slender form, evidently a young form. She painted ardently,  with confidence and absorption. As Antony watched her, her pose, her  ardour, the poise of her body, the lovely dark head, the gestures, the  fire of her, brought all of a sudden his past rushing back to him. The  sight of her came to him with a thrilling, wonderful remembrance. He  came forward, his light step and his heavy step falling on the hard wood  floors of the museum.    She turned before he was close to her, her palette and her brushes in  her hand. She stood for a moment immovable, then gave a little cry,  dropped her palette and brushes on the floor, grew white, then blushed  deeply and held out both her hands to him.    "Cousin Antony!"    He took her hands in his, could not find his voice even to say her name.  He heard her say--    "They told me you were dead! I thought you had died long ago--I thought  another man had taken your genius and your fame."    She spoke fast, with catching breath, in a low vibrant tone that he  remembered--how he did remember it! His very life seemed to breathe on  her lips in the sound of her voice. "Flow gently, sweet Afton"--the  music was here--here--all the music in the world!    "I know who you are now; I saw it in the paper. I read it this morning. 
Van MF.txt	451	1.0	1920	Van Vorst, Marie	Fairfax and his pride	I saw your picture, and I knew." She stopped to catch her breath deeply.  "Oh, I'm so glad!"    She was more beautiful than he had dreamed she would be; brilliant,  bewitching, and the flowers of his past clustered round her.    "I heard them falling through the rooms, the light step and the heavy  step."    Slowly by both her hands which he held he drew her toward him, and as he  held her cheek against his lips he heard her murmur--    "Back from the dead! Cousin Antony.... No, just Antony!"    "Little cousin!" he said. "Bella!"    THE END

IN one of the southern vales of Devon, where the myrtle is said to bloom unprotected, though visited by the sea-breeze, stood Fitzorton Castle.  A writer of descriptive talents, might, in respect of situation, expand himself into volumes; but, as the delineation of the minds and manners, the passions and pursuits, the strength and weakness, imaginations, and studies, of human beings, are more immediately the objects of this history, we must consider vegetable beauty, however fascinating, but as the scenery of our picture, and dismiss this part of our subject with as few words as possible.  The castle was erected on the sloping of a hill; the Manor-house of Clare on the declivity of an opposite mountain, with  a uniformity of taste corresponding to the sentiment which had long united the families; and at a distance only to render the prospect more engaging, a third venerable pile reared its head so centrically between the two, that, whether viewed from the manor-house or from the castle, the eye surveyed its aspiring turrets, the majestic avenues that led to its folding-gates, and the delightful woods that stretched themselves on either side.  Indeed, the three domains were placed amidst the very romance of Nature; but we are called from them at present by an earnest desire to introduce the reader to their inhabitants.      CHAPTER II.

THE Honourable and Reverend Armine Fitzorton, at the setting out of these annals, was in the seventy-fourth year of his age. He had been, for full sixty of that number, one of the healthiest and happiest men in the world. He married, early, a lady so entirely like himself  in mind, in manners, and as far as feminine softness may be permitted, without stepping out of itself, in person also, that a just portrait of one might give a striking resemblance of the other. They were of the same age to a day, and retained, in the same degree, the remains of those graces, which time itself seemed reluctant to destroy. Their very features, had, in some measure, triumphed over the tyrant who is, figuratively, said to rejoice in the ruins of mortality; and their eyes, of the same deep and lustrous colour, still retained much of their penetrating and shining power.  Their virtues might be divided, as some have divided virtue itself, into Benevolence, Prudence, Fortitude, and Temperance; and from like motives of division: because, Benevolence proposes good ends, Prudence suggests the best means of attaining them, Fortitude enables us to encounter the discouragements that stand in our way, and Temperance repels, and over-comes the passions that obstruct our progress.  Sir Armine brought with him, into holy orders, all the principle necessary to practise the precepts they enjoin. A sincere belief in those precepts formed, indeed, the most exalted ingredient in his worldly happiness; and the example of his life finely illustrated his doctrine, if we except the prime error that shaded his character a very strong tincture of bigotry in matters of religion.

'Sbud! man, you ought, upon that occasion, to give us an hornpipe upon your stumps, like Witherington; for two such pretty caitiffs as these do not come together every day, I can tell you! But, what are you all about, you lazy vagabonds,  shilly shally? If I were a parson, they should be married before I left the house: young folks can't begin to be happy too soon. Now look how that insufferable poltroon" (to Henry) "shakes and trembles: why, one would think, instead of feeling the flames of love on sitting so close to a fine girl, whose tell-tale blushes ought to make him blaze out like a bonfire, that the ague had got hold of him. By the arm of my body, he quivers like a Lapland witch! Well, come, I will give him my blessing in a bumper. However, marry when they will, may the pledges of their love be just as good-for-nothing as their parents! the girls abominable husseys, and the boys damned insufferable scoundrels! Put it round, old Vulcan!" said he, pushing the bottle to Sir Armine: he then stood up, and sung some stanzas, so replete with humour in themselves, and in so quaint and ludicrous a manner, that the whole company caught the hilarity of their worthy guest.

Shouldst thou, reader, be either a poet,  a lover, or both, thou wilt here exclaim, "if this be madness let me rave!" but, if thou art a reasoning being, and wise, that is, cold enough to keep the track of common sense, thou wilt pity or despise those distracted day-dreamers, and not being able to conceive any happiness in such phrenzy, think Bedlam, or St. Luke's, the only places proper to hold our two frantic young gentlemen.  Now as the frozen Caucasus and the burning Aetna do really exist in the natural world, so do these opposite degrees of heat and cold in the human temperament; and as it would be no less impossible to convince thee of even the transitory rapture of being mentally distracted, than to persuade the man of sanguine disposition, a Charles or a Henry, there was infinite gratification in carrying a lump of unthawed ice in the bosom by way of a heart, we shall attempt no means of reconciling such extremes, satisfied in our own mind, that intense heat and cold have their separate and peculiar use in the little globe of man's nature,  no less than in that great globe, the world itself.

The conversation ended with Henry's desiring to know the particulars of Olivia's plan.  "The particulars," replied Olivia, "would run into too much length for the time allowed us to detail it; but the substance is if it met your approbation to make Charles and Caroline  as independent as ourselves; but that only you and I should be concerned, or be in confidence of the means. Indeed it would be yet better if the parties themselves could imagine it came from some fund on which they had a claim. For this reason, I blame my hasty visit to the chapel-house, but you terrified me with the thoughts of their leaving us for ever. With your assistance, however, it may not yet be too late to redeem my rashness. At all events my heart is set upon their remaining amongst us."  Tell us, reader, if thou thinkest the ancient epicure Sardinapalus, or the modern voluptuary Quin, who is said to have expressed a wish that his throat had been a mile in length and every inch of it palate Tell us, if the Grecian Alexander, who conquered worlds, or the Roman Nero who rejoiced to throw them away, could, at any time of their lives, boast a feeling equal to that which possessed the mind of this amiable young woman while projecting to rebuild the fortunes of two persons, whom she valued only on account of their virtues and misfortunes, and as  they were dear to the man she loved?

But, short as was the space betwixt the determination and the departure of this little party, it was filled with incidents of great account to each individual.  The point was scarce agreed on, as to the time of setting out, ere True George, in that sort of haste which made him blow as if he was labouring with an asthma, and in which indeed he performed all his commissions, delivered a packet to Charles gave several reverential bows, with like rapidity in distinct respect, to every one present apportioning his bend to the degree of claim which each had on his affections, and then set off with the same speed he entered.  The billet contained these few words:    Charles,  That you may not suffer by surprise, expect,  within an hour from your receipt of this, a friendly call from  JOHN FITZORTON.    Though the surprise was broken by this note of annunciation, the curiosity which it excited, as to what might be the motive of the visit, was extreme.  Charles read the billet aloud to his friends, and the expectation of something extraordinary became general. They knew, indeed, that the writer of it would say nothing without a meaning, and that his meaning was always characteristic of himself, apposite to some point that he believed to be strong and momentous.

"Why the will I just now spoke of; and if it be so, how fortunate shall I think myself in not having destroyed or lost it; and you  must know, my good George, that while I was living alas! I then thought as innocently as happily in London, I had occasion to look into a kind of travelling chest which belonged to Sir Guise, and which Mr. Valentine Miles's man brought, saying it was full of old papers, it must be put into a careful place, as some of the papers might be of consequence, and were to be sorted; and I remember on the afternoon Mr. Dabble the attorney had settled some law business, I observed Sir Guise throw several packets into that chest, telling me he would have a fire lighted the next time he came, and could spare an hour to overlook and burn most of that trumpery; but this was forgotten, and as the baronet was then in a great hurry to go out, the key was forgot also, which I myself put into my pocket, with an intention to give it Sir Guise the next time he came, but it went out of my head, and as the lodgings were scanty of drawers and such conveniencies, I put into it any thing that would otherwise have laid littering about; in tumbling over these, I misplaced some of the papers which Sir Guise had thrown in for  burning, and was struck with these words on the back of one of them: 'Copy of Sir Marmaduke's will.' I don't know what possessed me to look into it, and though I could not very well make it out, I read sufficient to see it was much in favour of the baronet's children."

At the name of the two Atwoods, George, seeing John coming up to Partington, left them together, to enter into further explanations, and running to his Jane's father and brother, who had the Otleys still in their gripe, he gave them a hearty welcome, and had their hands been at liberty, would have demonstrated his sincerity by the usual token. But scarce a moment's opportunity was given for caress or conversation, as Partington  beckoned the Atwoods to advance with their prisoners; and as they passed him, Partington bowed very respectfully, telling them, as he thrust them into the room, where his own party were inclosed, "that they would there probably meet with an old acquaintance."  He now locked the door, put the key into his pocket, and clapping his own cudgel into George's hand, saying, "You must stand centinel here, you scoundrel, as you did at the inn at Adsell." He then gave his arm to John, and desiring the Atwoods to follow, they shut themselves into the apartment, which had been before, and as the reader will presently find was still decreed, by the powers that ruled on this eventful day, to be the room of justice. It may not, meantime, be improper to observe, that True George, previously to these arrangements, had dispatched the turnpike man to the place where the angry justice and his friends had betaken themselves, with a strict charge to have an eye on all their motions, and that they might not steal out of town before they had Mr.

Olivia's tears became, in a moment, softer than the dew; yet they were still to be seen  on her cheek, Henry was the first to observe them, for he felt them on his lips. "My dear Olivia has been weeping," said he, "how is this?" Ere she had time to answer this question, which breathed more melody and softness than the plaining notes of aerial music an innocent strife between the children, demanded the adjustment of their mother. Little Caroline, who, in her walks, was continually in search of something beautiful and singular in its kind, whether animated or vegetable, and who discovered an early taste and delicacy in the selection, had found what she deemed important, and came running with it in her closed hand towards her brother, asking, at every step, "How much he would give for a sight of what she had found?" "Nothing," answered John; "I can see it without paying for it, if I thought it worth while." Caroline defying him, John proceeded to actions, which discovered more of resolution than gallantry. Olivia observed "he should never be rude to young ladies, who were objects of protection, not of assault."  "Besides," said Henry, "it is not pretty to steal secrets, when people offer to sell them; but, if they did not, a secret is a thing sacred, and it is mean and wicked to pry into it." Before his father had done speaking, John desisted; and yielding his point, just as his uncle, on any stronger occasion, would have yielded, he ran to kiss the pretty hand that held the object of contention. Caroline, hereupon, would voluntarily have let him into the secret, which, in truth, was only a captive grashopper, had not Henry repeated his remark, as to the sanctity of a secret.

Her whole soul was filled with wonder, and with praise; and combining the bounty and protection which she and her dearest friends had received from the same sources, she rose in pious thought, and as her meditation ascended from sinite to infinite, her spirit communed with that power, who out of darkness and anarchy, natural and moral, can educe light, and bring forth order. "Ah, assure yourself, my dearest brother, and my honoured father," exclaimed she, "while all of us have thus been in the care of heaven's best creatures, they have been  wrought on in our favour by heaven itself! all of us were in need of divine assistance, and the manner in which the effects have been brought about cannot leave us a doubt of the cause."  "Blessed be his holy name," ejaculated Sir Guise.  Soon after this, the baronet confessed he felt much relieved by having paid the debt he thought due to the patrons of his repentance: and although the length and interruptions of his narrative had wearied his body, his spirits were lighter, and his mind more refreshed than it had been for some time.  In this tranquil period father Arthur came into the apartment, and entered on the vesper duties of his office; these being ended, the baronet declared his wish to devote the rest of the night to that repose which he augured he should best enjoy, if his slumbers were unbroken by the idea that his too diligent children were losing their own necessary restoratives: and this being a point insisted on by the apothecary, who had come in with Arthur, Sir Guise was left in the care of a single  attendant, and the rest of the party retired.

"The evil which has been growing for half the life of man, may, by the Providence of God, be in a moment removed. Let us rely on that Providence, and, by taking what at least appear the best measures, hope, that they will be directed to that end." Henry sighed, and assented. Partington was ductile to every generous aim. All was prepared with secrecy and dispatch; and while Partington was handing his party into the coach, railing and raving in whisper the colonel, who had been conducting his impeachment, and detailed his charges, brought round Mrs. Fitzorton to assist him in apprehending the conspirators.  "I seize you ladies and gentlemen," said John, "in the name of Olivia." "O thou most incorrigible good-for-nothing traitor!" exclaimed the Squire, bundling in little John, who enjoyed the scheme at his heart; and seeing Johanna with Olivia, "I have a good mind to have that handsome hussey into the bargain." Then shutting the door, after he had leaped in himself, he flourished his hat, crying "aha! this is trick for trick! one runaway job for another. Let the rascal see if he can escape again I have him now, father and son, old dame Partlet, and the family-coach into the bargain Drive on caitiffs drive on, and never stop till you get to the end of the world."

Even the servants, albeit in the practice of flying at the word of command, and inured to extraordinary expeditions, had never seen their squire in such a fury of preparation before. One of them was dispatched to the gypsey chief, to attend at the Bury that moment with the witness he mentioned; and when they appeared to the summons, Partington abused them as if they were two of the plagues of Egypt, kissed their discoloured hands with more devotion than he would have done those of Cleopatra, the queen of  their country, and gave Blondel the command of one of the armed chariots, ordered him to shut up the person who was one of his tribe in the same vehicle, and then follow the lead. Mrs. Herbert alone was made, in part, confidential; and her conduct thereupon so gratified the squire, that he regretted the young knaves, Henry's children, must have a she-thing to superintend them, ms;ince he was sure, from the manner in which that hussey, mother Herbert, had put a blunderbuss, and one of the broad-swords into the carriage, she would slice off an honest gentleman's head as neatly as any of those old tygresses, Boadicea, Zenobia, or Joan of Arc.

"God knows," replied John, "which of us is most in the right: but it is clear to me, that, although I give you full credit for your feelings and pity from my soul  all you must have suffered to conceal them, it appears very clear, that had Caroline Stuart been a protestant, you would never have been a catholic. We will not, however, discuss the point farther; for I am brought round to what I at first proposed to mention, by a very circuitous way. It has pleased the Omnipotent, my brother, to remove many apparently insuperable impediments; and the most inauspicious passion that, perhaps, the human heart ever set out with; as its only hope in the morning of life, has risen above several of the darkest clouds in the noon of your days. There is every reason to believe a renewal of your affections, now they may be innocently offered, would not be unacceptable to her, for whom, doubtless, your love can easily be revived." "Revived," exclaimed Henry,  "I will have one of my solitary thinkings on this matter," resumed John, smiling, but his face pallid, and care upon his brow. "Meantime be assured that I shall not allow you to suffer any pain, or forego  any pleasure, when it is consistent, and within my power to prevent the one and promote the other."

The lieutenant held one of the hands of his friend, and often pressed it to his bosom. The colonel took the other, from time to time whispering "Let what will be the issue, remember me!" Thus partly by remonstrance, and partly by hope, though each was slight yet, as the spark if nursed cautiously, and supplied, will afford some warmth, and some light, even if it baffles all care in the end, Henry suffered himself awhile to be comforted; insomuch that Arthur persuaded him to set his friends a social example by sitting down to the humble repast.  The morning hours, however, chased one another away without producing any sort o reply from the devotee; the day had already  dawned. Every vigilant eye and watchful ear of Arthur's party remained unclosed. Even the good father himself, whose attempered spirit had been long armed against the power of the general invaders of our brief life's tranquillity, was too sincerely interested in the event of Caroline's decision, to court that repose, or indeed, to partake of that refreshment, which health and virtue rarely denied him: and although he had blessed the board, and he regarded as his children all that were assembled, the viands were served, but untasted.

Lamentable, indeed, is the catalogue of human depravity he has exhibited; but, as the great motive which induced him to enter on such a laborious and painful estimate, was to point out the advantages which would result from a well-regulated and energetic police, conducted with purity, activity, vigilance, and discretion: we conceived that by employing a few of the most prominent facts, applicable to our purpose, from the soulaffrighting list, in a work of this nature, we might give the alarm to that part of the community which suffer most from one branch of the atrocities enumerated the corruptions of servants and dependents against whose arts masters and mistresses cannot be too well armed; and they are less likely to derive useful information of this kind from a systematic treatise, which they apprehend may pass the bound of their proper knowledge, than from books more immediately appropriate to their entertainment, and in which truths on every subject of awful import should, as it were, take them by surprize, and be so mixed with events as to interest while they warm. And it was further believed, that this mode would excite in the mind of every reader of the foregoing pages, an eager, though startled curiosity to peruse the whole of Mr. COLQUHOUN'S admirable plan for the prevention of crimes, founded on a detail of the means by which they are conducted to their horrible ends: a plan from which we most ardently join in the hope of the magistrate, that the public in general, and the legislature in particular, will, by giving effect to his well-meant endeavours, most amply reward the exertions he has used in the course of a very intricate and arduous investigation, in which his only object has been the good of his country. scorning patience and resisting conscience.

A fourteenth warning arises from shewing the danger of hazarding the happiness of a child in the momentous article of marriage, on any consideration, where the heart sanctions not the choice of the parent, even  though the hand is presented to beauty, elegance, and virtue: since nothing can be more certain, than that more mischief may result from one unhappy marriage, than from an army of men intent on destruction.  Such are some of the great aims proposed to be accomplished by this work as a whole; from a due contemplation of which, with the parts, must be collected its energy and colour, its ornament and utility. From the intention, we can with confidence claim some praise, for it has been sincere; from the execution we can derive nothing but hope. The labour has not been light, nor yet unattended by consolation; but if half a long life could bring the great moral and domestic truths to the point desired, we should exult in the means by which the ends were attained.

WoolVM.txt	0	0.33320000000000005	1925	Woolf, Virginia	Mrs Dalloway	    MRS. DALLOWAY said she would buy the flowers herself.    For Lucy had her work cut out for her. The doors would be taken off their hinges; Rumpelmayer’s men were coming. And then, thought Clarissa Dalloway, what a morning—fresh as if issued to children on a beach.    What a lark! What a plunge! For so it had always seemed to her, when, with a little squeak of the hinges, which she could hear now, she had burst open the French windows and plunged at Bourton into the open air. How fresh, how calm, stiller than this of course, the air was in the early morning; like the flap of a wave; the kiss of a wave; chill and sharp and yet (for a girl of eighteen as she then was) solemn, feeling as she did, standing there at the open window, that something awful was about to happen; looking at the flowers, at the trees with the smoke winding off them and the rooks rising, falling; standing and looking until Peter Walsh said, “Musing among the vegetables?”—was that it?—“I prefer men to cauliflowers”—was that it? He must have said it at breakfast one morning when she had gone out on to the terrace—Peter Walsh. He would be back from India one of these days, June or July, she forgot which, for his letters were awfully dull; it was his sayings one remembered; his eyes, his pocket-knife, his smile, his grumpiness and, when millions of things had utterly vanished—how strange it was!—a few sayings like this about cabbages. 
WoolVM.txt	1	0.33320000000000005	1925	Woolf, Virginia	Mrs Dalloway	  She stiffened a little on the kerb, waiting for Durtnall’s van to pass. A charming woman, Scrope Purvis thought her (knowing her as one does know people who live next door to one in Westminster); a touch of the bird about her, of the jay, blue-green, light, vivacious, though she was over fifty, and grown very white since her illness. There she perched, never seeing him, waiting to cross, very upright.    For having lived in Westminster—how many years now? over twenty,—one feels even in the midst of the traffic, or waking at night, Clarissa was positive, a particular hush, or solemnity; an indescribable pause; a suspense (but that might be her heart, affected, they said, by influenza) before Big Ben strikes. There! Out it boomed. First a warning, musical; then the hour, irrevocable. The leaden circles dissolved in the air. Such fools we are, she thought, crossing Victoria Street. For Heaven only knows why one loves it so, how one sees it so, making it up, building it round one, tumbling it, creating it every moment afresh; but the veriest frumps, the most dejected of miseries sitting on doorsteps (drink their downfall) do the same; can’t be dealt with, she felt positive, by Acts of Parliament for that very reason: they love life. In people’s eyes, in the swing, tramp, and trudge; in the bellow and the uproar; the carriages, motor cars, omnibuses, vans, sandwich men shuffling and swinging; brass bands; barrel organs; in the triumph and the jingle and the strange high singing of some aeroplane overhead was what she loved; life; London; this moment of June. 
WoolVM.txt	33	0.2499	1925	Woolf, Virginia	Mrs Dalloway	  Then, while a seedy-looking nondescript man carrying a leather bag stood on the steps of St. Paul’s Cathedral, and hesitated, for within was what balm, how great a welcome, how many tombs with banners waving over them, tokens of victories not over armies, but over, he thought, that plaguy spirit of truth seeking which leaves me at present without a situation, and more than that, the cathedral offers company, he thought, invites you to membership of a society; great men belong to it; martyrs have died for it; why not enter in, he thought, put this leather bag stuffed with pamphlets before an altar, a cross, the symbol of something which has soared beyond seeking and questing and knocking of words together and has become all spirit, disembodied, ghostly—why not enter in? he thought and while he hesitated out flew the aeroplane over Ludgate Circus.    It was strange; it was still. Not a sound was to be heard above the traffic. Unguided it seemed; sped of its own free will. And now, curving up and up, straight up, like something mounting in ecstasy, in pure delight, out from behind poured white smoke looping, writing a T, an O, an F.            “What are they looking at?” said Clarissa Dalloway to the maid who opened her door. 
WoolVM.txt	42	15.0	1925	Woolf, Virginia	Mrs Dalloway	  She was wearing pink gauze—was that possible? She seemed, anyhow, all light, glowing, like some bird or air ball that has flown in, attached itself for a moment to a bramble. But nothing is so strange when one is in love (and what was this except being in love?) as the complete indifference of other people. Aunt Helena just wandered off after dinner; Papa read the paper. Peter Walsh might have been there, and old Miss Cummings; Joseph Breitkopf certainly was, for he came every summer, poor old man, for weeks and weeks, and pretended to read German with her, but really played the piano and sang Brahms without any voice.    All this was only a background for Sally. She stood by the fireplace talking, in that beautiful voice which made everything she said sound like a caress, to Papa, who had begun to be attracted rather against his will (he never got over lending her one of his books and finding it soaked on the terrace), when suddenly she said, “What a shame to sit indoors!” and they all went out on to the terrace and walked up and down. Peter Walsh and Joseph Breitkopf went on about Wagner. She and Sally fell a little behind. Then came the most exquisite moment of her whole life passing a stone urn with flowers in it. Sally stopped; picked a flower; kissed her on the lips. The whole world might have turned upside down! The others disappeared; there she was alone with Sally. And she felt that she had been given a present, wrapped up, and told just to keep it, not to look at it—a diamond, something infinitely precious, wrapped up, which, as they walked (up and down, up and down), she uncovered, or the radiance burnt through, the revelation, the religious feeling!—when old Joseph and Peter faced them:    “Star-gazing?” said Peter. 
WoolVM.txt	55	0.16660000000000003	1925	Woolf, Virginia	Mrs Dalloway	  Clarissa sat very upright; drew in her breath.    “I am in love,” he said, not to her however, but to some one raised up in the dark so that you could not touch her but must lay your garland down on the grass in the dark.    “In love,” he repeated, now speaking rather dryly to Clarissa Dalloway; “in love with a girl in India.” He had deposited his garland. Clarissa could make what she would of it.    “In love!” she said. That he at his age should be sucked under in his little bow-tie by that monster! And there’s no flesh on his neck; his hands are red; and he’s six months older than I am! her eye flashed back to her; but in her heart she felt, all the same, he is in love. He has that, she felt; he is in love.    But the indomitable egotism which for ever rides down the hosts opposed to it, the river which says on, on, on; even though, it admits, there may be no goal for us whatever, still on, on; this indomitable egotism charged her cheeks with colour; made her look very young; very pink; very bright-eyed as she sat with her dress upon her knee, and her needle held to the end of green silk, trembling a little. He was in love! Not with her. With some younger woman, of course.    “And who is she?” she asked. 
WoolVM.txt	80	100800.0	1925	Woolf, Virginia	Mrs Dalloway	  For himself, he was absurd. His demands upon Clarissa (he could see it now) were absurd. He asked impossible things. He made terrible scenes. She would have accepted him still, perhaps, if he had been less absurd. Sally thought so. She wrote him all that summer long letters; how they had talked of him; how she had praised him, how Clarissa burst into tears! It was an extraordinary summer—all letters, scenes, telegrams—arriving at Bourton early in the morning, hanging about till the servants were up; appalling tete-a-tetes with old Mr. Parry at breakfast; Aunt Helena formidable but kind; Sally sweeping him off for talks in the vegetable garden; Clarissa in bed with headaches.    The final scene, the terrible scene which he believed had mattered more than anything in the whole of his life (it might be an exaggeration—but still so it did seem now) happened at three o’clock in the afternoon of a very hot day. It was a trifle that led up to it—Sally at lunch saying something about Dalloway, and calling him “My name is Dalloway”; whereupon Clarissa suddenly stiffened, coloured, in a way she had, and rapped out sharply, “We’ve had enough of that feeble joke.” That was all; but for him it was precisely as if she had said, “I’m only amusing myself with you; I’ve an understanding with Richard Dalloway.” So he took it. He had not slept for nights. “It’s got to be finished one way or the other,” he said to himself. He sent a note to her by Sally asking her to meet him by the fountain at three. “Something very important has happened,” he scribbled at the end of it. 
WoolVM.txt	81	5.0	1925	Woolf, Virginia	Mrs Dalloway	  The fountain was in the middle of a little shrubbery, far from the house, with shrubs and trees all round it. There she came, even before the time, and they stood with the fountain between them, the spout (it was broken) dribbling water incessantly. How sights fix themselves upon the mind! For example, the vivid green moss.    She did not move. “Tell me the truth, tell me the truth,” he kept on saying. He felt as if his forehead would burst. She seemed contracted, petrified. She did not move. “Tell me the truth,” he repeated, when suddenly that old man Breitkopf popped his head in carrying the Times; stared at them; gaped; and went away. They neither of them moved. “Tell me the truth,” he repeated. He felt that he was grinding against something physically hard; she was unyielding. She was like iron, like flint, rigid up the backbone. And when she said, “It’s no use. It’s no use. This is the end”—after he had spoken for hours, it seemed, with the tears running down his cheeks—it was as if she had hit him in the face. She turned, she left him, went away.    “Clarissa!” he cried. “Clarissa!” But she never came back. It was over. He went away that night. He never saw her again.            It was awful, he cried, awful, awful! 
WoolVM.txt	91	1.0	1925	Woolf, Virginia	Mrs Dalloway	  Who was it now who had done that? Peter Walsh asked himself, turning into the Broad Walk,—married a rich man and lived in a large house near Manchester? Somebody who had written him a long, gushing letter quite lately about “blue hydrangeas.” It was seeing blue hydrangeas that made her think of him and the old days—Sally Seton, of course! It was Sally Seton—the last person in the world one would have expected to marry a rich man and live in a large house near Manchester, the wild, the daring, the romantic Sally!    But of all that ancient lot, Clarissa’s friends—Whitbreads, Kinderleys, Cunninghams, Kinloch-Jones’s—Sally was probably the best. She tried to get hold of things by the right end anyhow. She saw through Hugh Whitbread anyhow—the admirable Hugh—when Clarissa and the rest were at his feet.    “The Whitbreads?” he could hear her saying. “Who are the Whitbreads? Coal merchants. Respectable tradespeople.”    Hugh she detested for some reason. He thought of nothing but his own appearance, she said He ought to have been a Duke. He would be certain to marry one of the Royal Princesses. And of course Hugh had the most extraordinary, the most natural, the most sublime respect for the British aristocracy of any human being he had ever come across. Even Clarissa had to own that. Oh, but he was such a dear, so unselfish, gave up shooting to please his old mother—remembered his aunts’ birthdays, and so on. 
WoolVM.txt	108	40320.0	1925	Woolf, Virginia	Mrs Dalloway	  Was he not like Keats? she asked; and reflected how she might give him a taste of Antony and Cleopatra and the rest; lent him books; wrote him scraps of letters; and lit in him such a fire as burns only once in a lifetime, without heat, flickering a red gold flame infinitely ethereal and insubstantial over Miss Pole; Antony and Cleopatra; and the Waterloo Road. He thought her beautiful, believed her impeccably wise; dreamed of her, wrote poems to her, which, ignoring the subject, she corrected in red ink; he saw her, one summer evening, walking in a green dress in a square. “It has flowered,” the gardener might have said, had he opened the door; had he come in, that is to say, any night about this time, and found him writing; found him tearing up his writing; found him finishing a masterpiece at three o’clock in the morning and running out to pace the streets, and visiting churches, and fasting one day, drinking another, devouring Shakespeare, Darwin, The History of Civilisation, and Bernard Shaw. 
WoolVM.txt	119	45.0	1925	Woolf, Virginia	Mrs Dalloway	  She had had to buy the roses, Rezia said, from a poor man in the street. But they were almost dead already, she said, arranging the roses.    So there was a man outside; Evans presumably; and the roses, which Rezia said were half dead, had been picked by him in the fields of Greece. “Communication is health; communication is happiness, communication—” he muttered.    “What are you saying, Septimus?” Rezia asked, wild with terror, for he was talking to himself.    She sent Agnes running for Dr. Holmes. Her husband, she said, was mad. He scarcely knew her.    “You brute! You brute!” cried Septimus, seeing human nature, that is Dr. Holmes, enter the room.    “Now what’s all this about?” said Dr. Holmes in the most amiable way in the world. “Talking nonsense to frighten your wife?” But he would give him something to make him sleep. And if they were rich people, said Dr. Holmes, looking ironically round the room, by all means let them go to Harley Street; if they had no confidence in him, said Dr. Holmes, looking not quite so kind.    It was precisely twelve o’clock; twelve by Big Ben; whose stroke was wafted over the northern part of London; blent with that of other clocks, mixed in a thin ethereal way with the clouds and wisps of smoke, and died up there among the seagulls—twelve o’clock struck as Clarissa Dalloway laid her green dress on her bed, and the Warren Smiths walked down Harley Street. Twelve was the hour of their appointment. Probably, Rezia thought, that was Sir William Bradshaw’s house with the grey motor car in front of it. The leaden circles dissolved in the air. 
WoolVM.txt	131	0.33320000000000005	1925	Woolf, Virginia	Mrs Dalloway	  A magnificent figure he cut too, pausing for a moment (as the sound of the half hour died away) to look critically, magisterially, at socks and shoes; impeccable, substantial, as if he beheld the world from a certain eminence, and dressed to match; but realised the obligations which size, wealth, health, entail, and observed punctiliously even when not absolutely necessary, little courtesies, old-fashioned ceremonies which gave a quality to his manner, something to imitate, something to remember him by, for he would never lunch, for example, with Lady Bruton, whom he had known these twenty years, without bringing her in his outstretched hand a bunch of carnations and asking Miss Brush, Lady Bruton’s secretary, after her brother in South Africa, which, for some reason, Miss Brush, deficient though she was in every attribute of female charm, so much resented that she said “Thank you, he’s doing very well in South Africa,” when, for half a dozen years, he had been doing badly in Portsmouth.    Lady Bruton herself preferred Richard Dalloway, who arrived at the next moment. Indeed they met on the doorstep.    Lady Bruton preferred Richard Dalloway of course. He was made of much finer material. But she wouldn’t let them run down her poor dear Hugh. She could never forget his kindness—he had been really remarkably kind—she forgot precisely upon what occasion. But he had been—remarkably kind. Anyhow, the difference between one man and another does not amount to much. She had never seen the sense of cutting people up, as Clarissa Dalloway did—cutting them up and sticking them together again; not at any rate when one was sixty-two. She took Hugh’s carnations with her angular grim smile. There was nobody else coming, she said. She had got them there on false pretences, to help her out of a difficulty—    “But let us eat first,” she said. 
WoolVM.txt	167	1.0	1925	Woolf, Virginia	Mrs Dalloway	  Miss Kilman took another cup of tea. Elizabeth, with her oriental bearing, her inscrutable mystery, sat perfectly upright; no, she did not want anything more. She looked for her gloves—her white gloves. They were under the table. Ah, but she must not go! Miss Kilman could not let her go! this youth, that was so beautiful, this girl, whom she genuinely loved! Her large hand opened and shut on the table.    But perhaps it was a little flat somehow, Elizabeth felt. And really she would like to go.    But said Miss Kilman, “I’ve not quite finished yet.”    Of course, then, Elizabeth would wait. But it was rather stuffy in here.    “Are you going to the party to-night?” Miss Kilman said. Elizabeth supposed she was going; her mother wanted her to go. She must not let parties absorb her, Miss Kilman said, fingering the last two inches of a chocolate éclair.    She did not much like parties, Elizabeth said. Miss Kilman opened her mouth, slightly projected her chin, and swallowed down the last inches of the chocolate éclair, then wiped her fingers, and washed the tea round in her cup.    She was about to split asunder, she felt. The agony was so terrific. If she could grasp her, if she could clasp her, if she could make her hers absolutely and forever and then die; that was all she wanted. But to sit here, unable to think of anything to say; to see Elizabeth turning against her; to be felt repulsive even by her—it was too much; she could not stand it. The thick fingers curled inwards. 
WoolVM.txt	177	0.2499	1925	Woolf, Virginia	Mrs Dalloway	  Going and coming, beckoning, signalling, so the light and shadow which now made the wall grey, now the bananas bright yellow, now made the Strand grey, now made the omnibuses bright yellow, seemed to Septimus Warren Smith lying on the sofa in the sitting-room; watching the watery gold glow and fade with the astonishing sensibility of some live creature on the roses, on the wall-paper. Outside the trees dragged their leaves like nets through the depths of the air; the sound of water was in the room and through the waves came the voices of birds singing. Every power poured its treasures on his head, and his hand lay there on the back of the sofa, as he had seen his hand lie when he was bathing, floating, on the top of the waves, while far away on shore he heard dogs barking and barking far away. Fear no more, says the heart in the body; fear no more.    He was not afraid. At every moment Nature signified by some laughing hint like that gold spot which went round the wall—there, there, there—her determination to show, by brandishing her plumes, shaking her tresses, flinging her mantle this way and that, beautifully, always beautifully, and standing close up to breathe through her hollowed hands Shakespeare’s words, her meaning. 
WoolVM.txt	242	2.0	1925	Woolf, Virginia	Mrs Dalloway	  “Yes, I have ten thousand a year”—whether before the tax was paid or after, she couldn’t remember, for her husband, “whom you must meet,” she said, “whom you would like,” she said, did all that for her.    And Sally used to be in rags and tatters. She had pawned her grandmother’s ring which Marie Antoinette had given her great-grandfather to come to Bourton.    Oh yes, Sally remembered; she had it still, a ruby ring which Marie Antoinette had given her greatgrandfather. She never had a penny to her name in those days, and going to Bourton always meant some frightful pinch. But going to Bourton had meant so much to her—had kept her sane, she believed, so unhappy had she been at home. But that was all a thing of the past—all over now, she said. And Mr. Parry was dead; and Miss Parry was still alive. Never had he had such a shock in his life! said Peter. He had been quite certain she was dead. And the marriage had been, Sally supposed, a success? And that very handsome, very self-possessed young woman was Elizabeth, over there, by the curtains, in red.    (She was like a poplar, she was like a river, she was like a hyacinth, Willie Titcomb was thinking. Oh how much nicer to be in the country and do what she liked! She could hear her poor dog howling, Elizabeth was certain.) She was not a bit like Clarissa, Peter Walsh said. 
WoolVM.txt	249	1.5	1925	Woolf, Virginia	Mrs Dalloway	  But Sir William Bradshaw stopped at the door to look at a picture. He looked in the corner for the engraver’s name. His wife looked too. Sir William Bradshaw was so interested in art.    When one was young, said Peter, one was too much excited to know people. Now that one was old, fifty-two to be precise (Sally was fifty-five, in body, she said, but her heart was like a girl’s of twenty); now that one was mature then, said Peter, one could watch, one could understand, and one did not lose the power of feeling, he said. No, that is true, said Sally. She felt more deeply, more passionately, every year. It increased, he said, alas, perhaps, but one should be glad of it—it went on increasing in his experience. There was some one in India. He would like to tell Sally about her. He would like Sally to know her. She was married, he said. She had two small children. They must all come to Manchester, said Sally—he must promise before they left.    There’s Elizabeth, he said, she feels not half what we feel, not yet. But, said Sally, watching Elizabeth go to her father, one can see they are devoted to each other. She could feel it by the way Elizabeth went to her father. 
WoolVM.txt	250	2.0	1925	Woolf, Virginia	Mrs Dalloway	  For her father had been looking at her, as he stood talking to the Bradshaws, and he had thought to himself. Who is that lovely girl? And suddenly he realised that it was his Elizabeth, and he had not recognised her, she looked so lovely in her pink frock! Elizabeth had felt him looking at her as she talked to Willie Titcomb. So she went to him and they stood together, now that the party was almost over, looking at the people going, and the rooms getting emptier and emptier, with things scattered on the floor. Even Ellie Henderson was going, nearly last of all, though no one had spoken to her, but she had wanted to see everything, to tell Edith. And Richard and Elizabeth were rather glad it was over, but Richard was proud of his daughter. And he had not meant to tell her, but he could not help telling her. He had looked at her, he said, and he had wondered, Who is that lovely girl? and it was his daughter! That did make her happy. But her poor dog was howling.    “Richard has improved. You are right,” said Sally. “I shall go and talk to him. I shall say good-night. What does the brain matter,” said Lady Rosseter, getting up, “compared with the heart?”    “I will come,” said Peter, but he sat on for a moment. What is this terror? what is this ecstasy? he thought to himself. What is it that fills me with extraordinary excitement?    It is Clarissa, he said.    For there she was.     
WinsKF.txt	0	1.0	1944	Winsor, Kathleen	Forever Amber	  “But, good God! What an age is this, and what a world is this! that a man cannot live without playing the knave and dissimulation.”    SAMUEL PEPYS            1644            PROLOGUE      THE SMALL ROOM was warm and moist. Furious blasts of thunder made the window-panes rattle and lightning seemed to streak through the room itself. No one had dared say what each was thinking—that this storm, violent even for mid-March, must be an evil omen.    As was customary for a lying-in chamber, the room had been largely cleared of its furniture. Now there remained only the bed with its tall head and footboards and linen side curtains, half a dozen low stools, and the midwife’s birth-stool, which had arm rests and a slanting back and cut-out seat. Beside the fireplace was a table with a pewter water-basin on it, brown cord and a knife, bottles and ointment-jars, and a pile of soft white cloths. Near the head of the bed was a very old hooded cradle, still empty.    The village women, all perfectly silent, stood close about the bed, watching what was happening there with tense, anxious faces. Sympathetic anguish, pity, apprehension, were the expressions they showed as their eyes shifted from the tiny red baby lying beside the woman who had just given it birth to the sweating midwife bending down and working with her hands beneath the spread blankets. One of the women, pregnant herself, leant over the child, her eyes frightened and troubled—and then all at once the baby gasped, gave a sneeze, and opening its mouth began to yell. The women sighed, relieved. 
WinsKF.txt	1	3.0	1944	Winsor, Kathleen	Forever Amber	  “Sarah—” the midwife said softly.    The pregnant woman looked up. They exchanged some words in low murmuring voices and then—as the midwife went to the fireplace and sat down to bathe the child from a basinful of warm red wine—the other slid her hands beneath the blankets and with firm gentle movements began to knead the mother’s abdomen. There was a look of strained anxiety on her face that amounted almost to horror, but it vanished swiftly as the woman on the bed slowly opened her eyes and looked at her.    Her face was drawn and haggard, with the strange new gauntness of prolonged suffering, and her eyes lay sunk in dark sockets. Only her light blonde hair, flung in a rumpled mass about her head, seemed still alive. As she spoke her voice, too, was thin and flat, scarcely above a whisper.    “Sarah—Sarah, is that my baby crying?”    Sarah did not stop working but nodded her head, forcing a quick bright smile. “Yes, Judith. That’s your baby—your daughter.” The baby’s angry-sounding squalls filled the room.    “My—daughter?” Even exhausted as she was, her disappointment was unmistakable. “A girl—” she said again, in a resentful tired little whisper. “But I wanted a boy. John would have wanted a boy.” Tears filled her eyes and ran from the corners, streaking across her temples; her head turned away, wearily, as if to escape the sound of the baby’s cries. 
WinsKF.txt	25	2.0	1944	Winsor, Kathleen	Forever Amber	  Now one of the men took off his hat and spoke to Lisbeth, presumably because she was the prettiest. “My services, madame,” he said, his voice and eyes lazily good-humoured, and as he looked her over slowly from head to foot Lisbeth blushed crimson and found it difficult to breathe. “We’re looking for a place to eat. Have you a good tavern in these parts?”    Lisbeth stared at him, temporarily speechless, while he continued to smile down at her, his hands resting easily on the saddle before him. His suit was black velvet with a short doublet and wide knee-length breeches, finished with golden braid. He had dark hair and green-grey eyes and a narrow black mustache lined his upper lip. His good looks were spectacular—but they were not the most important thing about him. For his face had an uncompromising ruthlessness and strength which marked him, in spite of his obvious aristocracy, as an adventurer and gambler, a man free from bonds and ties.    Lisbeth swallowed and made a little curtsy. “Ye mun like the Three Cups in Heathstone, m’lord.” She was afraid to recommend her own poor little village to these splendid strangers.    “Where’s Heathstone from here?”    “Heathstone be damned!” protested one of the men. “What’s wrong with your own ordinary? I’ll fall off this jade if I go another mile without food!” He was a handsome blonde red-faced young man and in spite of his scowl he was obviously happy and good-natured. As he spoke the others laughed and one of them leaned over to clap him on the shoulder. 
WinsKF.txt	100	2.0	1944	Winsor, Kathleen	Forever Amber	  Bruce finally turned back, spoke to the driver and got in, sitting down beside her as the coach gave a jog and started to move. He took one of her hands in his. “You’ve set the town by its ears. That was my Lord Buckhurst and he says you’re far more beautiful than Barbara Palmer.”    “You mean the King’s mistress?”    “Yes. How the devil do you manage to get all the current gossip?” He looked down at her, amused as though she were a pretty doll or a plaything.    “The dressmaker told me about her. Bruce—who were those two ladies? The ones in the next box that waved to you?”    “Wives of friends of mine. Why?”    She looked down at her fan, frowning, counting the sticks. “Did you see how they looked at me? Like this—” She pulled her face into a sudden grimace, a perfect though somewhat exaggerated and malicious imitation of the stares they had given her. “They think I’m a harlot—I know they do!”    Bruce gave her a look of surprise and then, to her astonishment, threw back his head and laughed.    “Well!” she cried, offended. “What the devil is there to laugh at, pray?”    She was beginning already to pick up some of his expressions, words and phrases Matt Goodegroome would never have allowed even his sons to use. It seemed to Amber that all fine persons swore and that it was a mark of good breeding. 
WinsKF.txt	119	2628000.0	1944	Winsor, Kathleen	Forever Amber	  She was well enough acquainted with the early symptoms of pregnancy for she had often discussed the subject with those of her friends who were married, and she had watched Sarah carry four children during the years since she had been old enough to notice such things. But by the end of June, when they had been in London almost two months, she still had no reason to think herself with child. And so, to settle her own suspense, she went to consult an astrologer.    It was no very difficult matter to find one for they were all over the city, thick as flies in a cook-shop, and she set out one day in Bruce’s coach-and-four to learn her fortune from a certain Mr. Chout. She watched as they rode along and when she saw a sign marked with a moon, six stars, and a hand, she called to the driver to stop and sent the footman to knock at the door. The astrologer, who had peeked out the window and seen her crested coach, came forth himself to invite her in.    He did not look to her like a mystic. He had a large red face, dirt-clogged pores covered his nose, and there was a rank odour about him. But he greeted her so obsequiously, bowing as though she were a duchess of the blood royal, that her confidence in him increased. 
WinsKF.txt	164	20.0	1944	Winsor, Kathleen	Forever Amber	  As they went inside and began to mount the stairs Amber reluctantly followed Sally Goodman’s example and put on her vizard. What’s the good of a pretty face, she thought, if no one’s to see it? and she let her cloak fall back, showing her figure. But in spite of the mask there was no doubt she attracted attention. For as they walked along, pausing now and then to examine a pair of gloves, some embroidered ribbons, a length of lace, enthusiastic comments followed them.    “She’s handsome—very handsome! By God, but she is!”    “Those killing eyes!”    “As pretty a girl, for a fortnight’s use or so, as a man could wish.”    Amber began to feel pleased and excited and she cast furtive sidelong glances to see how many men were watching her and what they looked like. Mrs. Goodman, however, took another view of the compliments. She clucked her tongue and shook her head.    “Lord, how bawdy the young men talk nowadays!”    Somewhat abashed at this Amber guarded her eyes and frowned a little, to show that she was displeased too. But the frown did not last long—for she was half-intoxicated by the sights and sounds all about her.    She wanted to buy almost everything she saw. She had little sense of discrimination, her acquisitive instincts were strong, and she felt so boundlessly rich that there seemed no reason why she might not have whatever she desired. Finally she stopped before a stall where a plump black-eyed young woman stood surrounded by dozens of bird-cages, painted gold or silver or bright colours; in each one was a brilliant bird, canaries, parrots, cockatoos brought back by the East India Company or some merchant fleet. 
WinsKF.txt	200	5760.0	1944	Winsor, Kathleen	Forever Amber	  As Amber lay in bed, coughing and blowing her nose, her very bones seeming to ache and her head feeling as though it was stuffed with cotton, she began to worry. She knew that she had been a fool, that they had played a trick on her that must be old as time and worn threadbare by usage. With her country-girl gullibility she had walked into their trap, as innocent as a woodcock. And she had nothing for consolation but the sureness that they had been almost as much mistaken in her. For now she was convinced that Luke had thought he was marrying a real heiress and that they had left only when the mistake was discovered.    By the third day the hall outside her room was aswarm with creditors, all of them demanding payment. And when Amber went to the door wrapped in a blanket and told them that her husband had run away and she had no money they threatened to bring action against her. At last she refused to answer any more and shouted at them to go away and leave her alone. Then this morning the constable had come, told her to get dressed and taken her off to Newgate. She would not be tried, he said, until the quarter-session and then—if found guilty of .her large debt—she would be sentenced to remain in Newgate until it was paid. 
WinsKF.txt	415	20160.0	1944	Winsor, Kathleen	Forever Amber	  He probably wouldn’t be as generous as he is now, either, and if I spent thirty pound for a new gown there’d be trouble and he’d think last year’s cloak could do me again. First thing you know I’d grow fat and pot-bellied and dwindle into a wife —and before I was twenty my life would be over. No, I like it better this way. I’ve got all the advantages of being a wife because he loves me and won’t put me aside, and none of the disadvantages because I’m free and my own mistress and can leave him any time I like.    She had heard that King Charles had remarked more than once he considered her to be the finest-woman on the stage, and that in particular after her last performance at Hampton Court he had told someone he envied the man who kept her.            A fortnight or so after Almsbury’s return to town Amber got a new maid. She dismissed Gatty one day when the girl surprised her taking a bath and talking to his Lordship, sending her away with the warning that Almsbury had a great interest at Court and would order her tongue cut out if she spoke to anyone at all of what she had seen. She told Rex that she had turned the girl away because she was pregnant, and sent Jeremiah to post a notice for a serving-woman in St. Paul’s Cathedral, where a good deal of such business was done. 
WinsKF.txt	813	180.0	1944	Winsor, Kathleen	Forever Amber	  But by nightfall Amber seemed, if possible, to be even worse. A carbuncle had begun to swell in her right groin and though it grew larger it remained hard and gave no indication that it would suppurate. Sykes was anxious about that, for it was the worst possible sign, and not even the mustard plasters she applied—which blistered the skin—seemed to have any effect.    “What can we do?” Bruce asked her. “There must be something we can do! What have you done for your patients when the carbuncle wouldn’t break?”    Sykes was staring down at Amber. “Nothing, sir,” she said slowly. “Most usually they die.”    “She’s not going to die!” he cried. “We’ll do something. We’ve got to do something—She can’t die!” He looked less well than he had the day before but he forced himself to stay awake, as though he could keep her alive by holding a vigil over her.    “We might cut into it,” she said. “If it’s still like this tomorrow. That’s what the doctors do. But the pain of the knife sometimes drives ’em mad—”    “Shut up! I don’t want to hear it! Go out and get her something to eat.”    He was almost exhausted and his temper was quick and savage, for he suffered agonizingly over his own impotence. It went through his mind over and over again. She’s sick because of me and now, when she needs me, I lie here like a sot and am able to do nothing! 
WinsKF.txt	828	90.0	1944	Winsor, Kathleen	Forever Amber	  If he asked the guard for help she would overhear him, and he had no reason to think that the guard could be trusted. There seemed no choice; he must try to handle the situation himself. She would not be likely, he thought, to use a knife, for that would leave tell-tale wounds. Strangulation with a length of cord or rope should be easy with both of them as weak as they were; and she would try to kill him first, for Amber could make no more resistance than a kitten. But having thought that far lie found himself confronted by problems that, in his state of weakness, seemed insoluble. If he closed the door and waited behind it she would know he was there, and he could not outwait her. If he locked it she could force her way in, and in any open battle he was no match for her, for though his strength might be greater he was unable to move about quickly and would soon be exhausted.    At last he decided to make a bundle of blankets in the bed and wait there next to it, concealed behind the window hangings. If she came near he could strike her over the head with a heavy pewter candlestick. But the plan was spoiled, for she refused to close the door. When he asked her to do so, just as it was growing dark, she obeyed, but a few minutes later he heard it opening, very slowly. It remained ajar just an inch or so for more than an hour, and then he called out to her again. 
WinsKF.txt	889	2.0	1944	Winsor, Kathleen	Forever Amber	  “These may be appreciated without a knowledge of the language. They make use of the universal language of pictures.”    She at once understood what he meant and paused, caught by her own strong interest in whatever was sensational or prurient. With a smile which clearly betrayed his cynical amusement at her curiosity he turned and took down from a shelf a hand-tooled leather-bound volume, laid it on the table, and stood waiting. She turned, and for a moment hesitated, watching him suspiciously as though this were some trap he had set for her. Then with a defiant lift of her chin she walked forward and opened the book, turned half-a-dozen pages on which was some unrecognizable printing and stopped with a gasp of surprise at the first picture. It was beautifully done, painted by hand, and showed a young man and woman, both of them naked, straining in an ecstasy.    For a moment Amber looked at it, fascinated. Suddenly she glanced up and found him watching her, carefully, with the same expression she had seen that day in Almsbury’s library. It disappeared again, as swiftly as the time before; and she picked up the book and started across the room.    “I thought you’d be interested,” she heard him saying, “but pray handle it carefully. It’s very old and very rare—a treasure of its kind.”    She did not answer or look around but went on out of the room. She felt bewildered and angry, both pleasantly excited and disgusted. It seemed, somehow, that he had taken an advantage of her. 
WinsKF.txt	892	1.0	1944	Winsor, Kathleen	Forever Amber	  “The Earl of Radclyffe! The Countess of Radclyffe!”    The Earl of Radclyffe. Who the devil was he? Some moss-backed old dodderer left over from the last generation? And his countess—a platter-faced jade of at least five-and-forty, no doubt, who disapproved of the new manners as violently as any Puritan alderman’s wife. They looked toward the doorway with a kind of bored curiosity. Then, as Lord and Lady Radclyffe appeared, surprise and shock flowed over the room, snapping them out of their lazy indifference. What was this! An actress being presented at Court!    “Jesus Christ!” remarked one gentleman to another. “Isn’t that Amber St. Clare?”    “Why!” hissed an indignant lady. “That’s that comedian—Madame What-d’ye-call who was at the Theatre Royal a couple of years ago!”    “Intolerable!”    Amber kept her head high and looked neither right nor left, but straight ahead toward the Queen. She had never felt so nervously excited, so eager, or so scared. I really am a countess, she had been telling herself all day. I’ve got as much right at Whitehall as anyone. I won’t let ’em scare me—I won’t! They’re only men and women—they’re no different from me or anyone else. But the truth was she did believe them different—here, at least, in Whitehall. 
WinsKF.txt	1024	2.0	1944	Winsor, Kathleen	Forever Amber	  “God’s eyeballs! What kept you so long? Have you got a wench in here?”    She tossed her black-beaver muff onto a chair, untied the hood she wore and flung off both it and the cloak. Then going to the fire to warm herself she nudged aside with her foot the thin mongrel dog that slept uneasily there, and which now looked up at her with injured resentment.    “God in Heaven!” she exclaimed, rubbing her hands together and shivering. “But I swear it’s the coldest night known to man! It’s blowing a mackerel-gale!”    “May I offer your Ladyship a glass of ale?”    “By all means!”    Heydon went to a dresser and poured out a glassful, saying with a sideways glance at her: “I regret that I cannot offer your Ladyship something more delicate—claret or champagne—but it is my misfortune that too many of my patrons are remiss in their debts.” He shrugged. “They say that comes of serving the rich.”    “Still plucking at the same string, eh?” She took the glass from him and began to swallow thirstily, feeling the sour ale slide down and begin to warm her entrails. “I have a matter of the utmost importance I want you to settle for me. It’s imperative that you make no mistake!”    “Was not my last prognostication correct, your Ladyship?”    He was leaning forward slightly from the waist, his big-jointed hands clasped before him, obsequiousness as well as an unctuous demand for praise in his voice and manner. 
WinsKF.txt	1176	4320.0	1944	Winsor, Kathleen	Forever Amber	  He got to his feet. “Very well then, madame. Trouble me no more and we’ll get along well enough. Live any way you like, but live as quietly as you can. And one thing more: If you tell no one about this, no one will know it—for I’ll not mention it.”    “Oh, thank you, Sire! You are kind!”    She came to stand before him and looked up into his face, her eyes coaxing, inviting him. She still hoped that a kiss and half an hour in bed could change everything—expunge the animosity and distrust which had grown out of the passionate infatuation with which they had begun. He stared at her steadily and then, very faintly, he smiled; his hand made a light gesture and he walked beyond her and out of the room. Barbara turned to watch him, stunned, as though she had had a slap in the face.    A couple of days later she went into the country to have an abortion, for this child, she knew, he would never own. But it had also occurred to her that if she was gone for a few weeks he would forget everything that had been unpleasant between them and begin to miss her—he would send for her to come back, as he had done in the old days. Someday, she told herself, he’ll love me again, I know he will. Next time we meet, things will be different. 
WinsKF.txt	1436	1.5	1944	Winsor, Kathleen	Forever Amber	  “My lord?” Her voice was cold, sharp.    “Your Grace is abroad early.”    Unexpectedly she was ready with a facile lie. “Lady Almsbury is ill—she sent for me. And isn’t this early for you, too, my lord?” she inquired tartly.    “It is, madame. I go on a mission of the gravest importance—I’ve just got word the King’s sister died yesterday morning.”    For a moment Amber was shocked into forgetfulness of her own affairs. “Minette?” she repeated. “Minette—dead?”    “She is, madame.” He bowed his head.    “Oh. I’m sorry.” She had an instant of passionate pity for Charles.    Then the Baron raised his head again and looked at her. All at once she saw some strange gleam of amusement in his eyes. She glanced swiftly at Buckingham—he was smiling. Both of them seemed to be laughing at her. What was it? What did they know? What had happened? It must be something that concerned her, something unpleasant, to please them so much.    And then, with sudden unexpected relief she realized that it no longer mattered. In another hour she would be gone from England—gone from Whitehall and its plots and schemes forever. She would never come back again, never. She would not have believed it possible, even yesterday, that she could be so glad to leave England.    I’m so sick of all of you, she thought. Then Arlington was speaking again. 
WinsKF.txt	1437	1.0	1944	Winsor, Kathleen	Forever Amber	  “Don’t let me detain you, madame. Your business, also, is important. You mustn’t be late.”    Amber curtsied, the Baron bowed, and they passed.    Buckingham looked around over his shoulder, Arlington did not look back, but they exchanged smiles. “Good riddance,” muttered the Duke. Then suddenly he laughed. “Gad, but I wish I could see her face when she arrives in Virginia and finds Lady Carlton in good health! I congratulate you, sir. Your plot worked better than I hoped. We’ve put that troublesome jade out of our way.”    “Her Grace may be gone,” said Arlington. “But there’s never an end to trouble here at Whitehall.” The tone of his voice was significant and Buckingham looked at him with quick suspicion. Arlington’s face turned blank. “Come, your Grace—there are matters of real importance to attend to this morning.”    Amber had picked up her skirts and started to run. Outdoors it was growing light and the sun streaked over the tops of the brick buildings. Her coach stood waiting. As he saw her coming the footman flung open the door and reared back in rigid attention; she laughed and gave a snip of her fingers at his braid-covered chest as she climbed in. Imperturbably he slammed the door, motioned to the driver and the coach rolled forward. Still laughing, she leaned out, and waved at the closed empty windows.            THE END           
PuzoMTG.txt	0	1.0	1969	Puzo, Mario	The Godfather	        BOOK I    Behind every great fortune there is a crime.    —BALZAC            Chapter 1    Amerigo Bonasera sat in New York Criminal Court Number 3 and waited for justice; vengeance on the men who had so cruelly hurt his daughter, who had tried to dishonor her.    The judge, a formidably heavy-featured man, rolled up the sleeves of his black robe as if to physically chastise the two young men standing before the bench. His face was cold with majestic contempt. But there was something false in all this that Amerigo Bonasera sensed but did not yet understand.    “You acted like the worst kind of degenerates,” the judge said harshly. Yes, yes, thought Amerigo Bonasera. Animals. Animals. The two young men, glossy hair crew cut, scrubbed clean-cut faces composed into humble contrition, bowed their heads in submission.    The judge went on. “You acted like wild beasts in a jungle and you are fortunate you did not sexually molest that poor girl or I’d put you behind bars for twenty years.” The judge paused, his eyes beneath impressively thick brows flickered slyly toward the sallow-faced Amerigo Bonasera, then lowered to a stack of probation reports before him. He frowned and shrugged as if convinced against his own natural desire. He spoke again. 
PuzoMTG.txt	1	5.0	1969	Puzo, Mario	The Godfather	  “But because of your youth, your clean records, because of your fine families, and because the law in its majesty does not seek vengeance, I hereby sentence you to three years’ confinement to the penitentiary. Sentence to be suspended.”    Only forty years of professional mourning kept the overwhelming frustration and hatred from showing on Amerigo Bonasera’s face. His beautiful young daughter was still in the hospital with her broken jaw wired together; and now these two animales went free? It had all been a farce. He watched the happy parents cluster around their darling sons. Oh, they were all happy now, they were smiling now.    The black bile, sourly bitter, rose in Bonasera’s throat, overflowed through tightly clenched teeth. He used his white linen pocket handkerchief and held it against his lips. He was standing so when the two young men strode freely up the aisle, confident and cool-eyed, smiling, not giving him so much as a glance. He let them pass without saying a word, pressing the fresh linen against his mouth.    The parents of the animales were coming by now, two men and two women his age but more American in their dress. They glanced at him, shamefaced, yet in their eyes was an odd, triumphant defiance. 
PuzoMTG.txt	26	5.0	1969	Puzo, Mario	The Godfather	  So that was what he wanted to do. Hagen noticed the change in Don Corleone. The Don received Brasi as a king greets a subject who has done him an enormous service, never familiar but with regal respect. With every gesture, with every word, Don Corleone made it clear to Luca Brasi that he was valued. Not for one moment did he show surprise at the wedding gift being presented to him personally. He understood.    The money in the envelope was sure to be more than anyone else had given. Brasi had spent many hours deciding on the sum, comparing it to what the other guests might offer. He wanted to be the most generous to show that he had the most respect, and that was why he had given his envelope to the Don personally, a gaucherie the Don overlooked in his own flowery sentence of thanks. Hagen saw Luca Brasi’s face lose its mask of fury, swell with pride and pleasure. Brasi kissed the Don’s hand before he went out the door that Hagen held open. Hagen prudently gave Brasi a friendly smile which the squat man acknowledged with a polite stretching of rubbery, veal-colored lips. 
PuzoMTG.txt	126	5.0	1969	Puzo, Mario	The Godfather	Again there was no answer. This worried him but he put it out of his mind. Luca would come to the house as soon as he heard the news. Sonny leaned back in the swivel chair. In an hour the house would be swarming with Family people and he would have to tell them all what to do, and now that he finally had time to think he realized how serious the situation was. It was the first challenge to the Corleone Family and their power in ten years. There was no doubt that Sollozzo was behind it, but he would never have dared attempt such a stroke unless he had support from at least one of the five great New York Families. And that support must have come from the Tattaglias. Which meant a full-scale war or an immediate settlement on Sollozzo’s terms. Sonny smiled grimly. The wily Turk had planned well but he had been unlucky. The old man was alive and so it was war. With Luca Brasi and the resources of the Corleone Family there could be but one outcome. But again the nagging worry. Where was Luca Brasi?            Chapter 3    Counting the driver, there were four men in the car with Hagen. They put him in the back seat, in the middle of the two men who had come up behind him in the street. Sollozzo sat up front. The man on Hagen’s right reached over across his body and tilted Hagen’s hat over his eyes so that he could not see. “Don’t even move your pinkie,” he said. 
PuzoMTG.txt	148	45.0	1969	Puzo, Mario	The Godfather	  Clemenza finally narrowed down the list of candidates to three men. The first was an enforcer who worked with the colored policy bankers in Harlem, a big brawny brute of a man of great physical strength, a man with a great deal of personal charm who could get along with people and yet when necessary make them go in fear of him. But Clemenza scratched him off the list after considering his name for a half hour. This man got along too well with the black people, which hinted at some flaw of character. Also he would be too hard to replace in the position he now held.    The second name Clemenza considered and almost settled on was a hard-working chap who served faithfully and well in the organization. This man was the collector of delinquent accounts for Family-licensed shylocks in Manhattan. He had started off as a bookmaker’s runner. But he was not quite yet ready for such an important promotion.    Finally he settled on Rocco Lampone. Lampone had served a short but impressive apprenticeship in the Family. During the war he had been wounded in Africa and been discharged in 1943. Because of the shortage of young men, Clemenza had taken him on even though Lampone was partially incapacitated by his injuries and walked with a pronounced limp. Clemenza had used him as a black-market contact in the garment center and with government employees controlling OPA food stamps. From that, Lampone had graduated to trouble-shooter for the whole operation. What Clemenza liked about him was his good judgment. He knew that there was no percentage in being tough about something that would only cost a heavy fine or six months in jail, small prices to pay for the enormous profits earned. He had the good sense to know that it was not an area for heavy threats but light ones. He kept the whole operation in a minor key, which was exactly what was needed. 
PuzoMTG.txt	179	90.0	1969	Puzo, Mario	The Godfather	  “It’s not bad,” Kay said in a judicious voice.    They dozed off until Michael suddenly started up anxiously and looked at his watch. “Damn,” he said. “It’s nearly ten. I have to get down to the hospital.” He went to the bathroom to wash up and comb his hair. Kay came in after him and put her arms around his waist from behind. “When are we going to get married?” she asked.    “Whenever you say,” Michael said. “As soon as this family thing quiets down and my old man gets better. I think you’d better explain things to your parents though.”    “What should I explain?” Kay said quietly.    Michael ran the comb through his hair. “Just say that you’ve met a brave, handsome guy of Italian descent. Top marks at Dartmouth. Distinguished Service Cross during the war plus the Purple Heart. Honest. Hard-working. But his father is a Mafia chief who has to kill bad people, sometimes bribe high government officials and in his line of work gets shot full of holes himself. But that has nothing to do with his honest hardworking son. Do you think you can remember all that?”    Kay let go his body and leaned against the door of the bathroom. “Is he really?” she said. “Does he really?” She paused. “Kill people?”    Michael finished combing his hair. “I don’t really know,” he said. “Nobody really knows.
PuzoMTG.txt	180	20.0	1969	Puzo, Mario	The Godfather	But I wouldn’t be surprised.”    Before he went out the door she asked, “When will I see you again?”    Michael kissed her. “I want you to go home and think things over in that little hick town of yours,” he said. “I don’t want you to get mixed up in this business in any way. After the Christmas holidays I’ll be back at school and we’ll get together up in Hanover. OK?”    “OK,” she said. She watched him go out the door, saw him wave before he stepped into the elevator. She had never felt so close to him, never so much in love and if someone had told her she would not see Michael again until three years passed, she would not have been able to bear the anguish of it.            WHEN MICHAEL GOT out of the cab in front of the French Hospital he was surprised to see that the street was completely deserted. When he entered the hospital he was even more surprised to find the lobby empty. Damn it, what the hell were Clemenza and Tessio doing? Sure, they never went to West Point but they knew enough about tactics to have outposts. A couple of their men should have been in the lobby at least. 
PuzoMTG.txt	355	4320.0	1969	Puzo, Mario	The Godfather	We had to be aware. And you never spoke about him.”    For the first time Kay was grateful that Michael was never affectionate in his letters. She was grateful that her parents hadn’t seen some of her letters. “I never told you about him because I thought you’d be horrified about his family.”    “We were,” Mr. Adams said cheerfully. “By the way, has Michael gotten in touch with you?”    Kay shook her head. “I don’t believe he’s guilty of anything.”    She saw her parents exchange a glance over the table. Then Mr. Adams said gently, “If he’s not guilty and he’s vanished, then perhaps something else happened to him.”    At first Kay didn’t understand. Then she got up from the table and ran to her room.            THREE DAYS LATER Kay Adams got out of a taxi in front of the Corleone mall in Long Beach. She had phoned, she was expected. Tom Hagen met her at the door and she was disappointed that it was him. She knew he would tell her nothing.    In the living room he gave her a drink. She had seen a couple of other men lounging around the house but not Sonny. She asked Tom Hagen directly, “Do you know where Mike is? Do you know where I can get in touch with him?”    Hagen said smoothly, “We know he’s all right but we don’t know where he is right now. When he heard about that captain being shot he was afraid they’d accuse him. So he just decided to disappear. He told me he’d get in touch in a few months.”    The story was not only false but meant to be seen through, he was giving her that much. “Did that captain really break his jaw?” Kay asked. 
PuzoMTG.txt	397	300.0	1969	Puzo, Mario	The Godfather	  Carlo had gone to the track for that afternoon and when he came home in the late evening he was sore at losing and half drunk from the bottle he always carried. As soon as he stepped into the door, Connie started screaming curses at him. He ignored her and went in to take a shower. When he came out he dried his naked body in front of her and started dolling up to go out.    Connie stood with hands on hips, her face pointy and white with rage. “You’re not going anyplace,” she said. “Your girl friend called and said she can’t make it tonight. You lousy bastard, you have the nerve to give your whores my phone number. I’ll kill you, you bastard.” She rushed at him, kicking and scratching.    He held her off with one muscular forearm. “You’re crazy,” he said coldly. But she could see he was worried, as if he knew the crazy girl he was screwing would actually pull such a stunt. “She was kidding around, some nut,” Carlo said.    Connie ducked around his arm and clawed at his face. She got a little bit of his cheek under her fingernails. With surprising patience he pushed her away. She noticed he was careful because of her pregnancy and that gave her the courage to feed her rage. She was also excited. Pretty soon she wouldn’t be able to do anything, the doctor had said no sex for the last two months and she wanted it, before the last two months started. Yet her wish to inflict a physical injury on Carlo was very real too. She followed him into the bedroom. 
PuzoMTG.txt	409	9.0	1969	Puzo, Mario	The Godfather	  It was no more than a few minutes. Hagen got control of himself again and picked up the phone. He called Connie’s number. It rang for a long time before Connie answered in a whisper.    Hagen spoke to her gently. “Connie, this is Tom. Wake your husband up, I have to talk to him.”    Connie said in a low frightened voice, “Tom, is Sonny coming here?”    “No,” Hagen said. “Sonny’s not coming there. Don’t worry about that. Just wake Carlo up and tell him it’s very important I speak to him.”    Connie’s voice was weepy. “Tom, he beat me up, I’m afraid he’ll hurt me again if he knows I called home.”    Hagen said gently, “He won’t. He’ll talk to me and I’ll straighten him out. Everything will be OK. Tell him it’s very important, very, very important he come to the phone. OK?”    It was almost five minutes before Carlo’s voice came over the phone, a voice half slurred by whiskey and sleep. Hagen spoke sharply to make him alert. 
PuzoMTG.txt	433	15768000.0	1969	Puzo, Mario	The Godfather	  His personality was unpleasant to these men. He was a whiner, always complaining of the costs in his Family business. Laundry bills, all those towels, ate up the profits (but he owned the laundry firm that did the work). The girls were lazy and unstable, running off, committing suicide. The pimps were treacherous and dishonest and without a shred of loyalty. Good help was hard to find. Young lads of Sicilian blood turned up their noses at such work, considered it beneath their honor to traffic and abuse women; those rascals who would slit a throat with a song on their lips and the cross of an Easter palm in the lapel of their jackets. So Phillip Tattaglia would rant on to audiences unsympathetic and contemptuous. His biggest howl was reserved for authorities who had it in their power to issue and cancel liquor licenses for his nightclubs and cabarets. He swore he had made more millionaires than Wall Street with the money he had paid those thieving guardians of official seals.    In a curious way his almost victorious war against the Corleone Family had not won him the respect it deserved. They knew his strength had come first from Sollozzo and then from the Barzini Family. Also the fact that with the advantage of surprise he had not won complete victory was evidence against him. If he had been more efficient, all this trouble could have been avoided. The death of Don Corleone would have meant the end of the war. 
PuzoMTG.txt	554	2.0	1969	Puzo, Mario	The Godfather	“If I asked you to marry me, would I have to answer that question first before you’d give me an answer to mine?”    Kay said, “I don’t care, I love you, I don’t care. If you loved me you wouldn’t be afraid to tell me the truth. You wouldn’t be afraid I might tell the police. That’s it, isn’t it? You’re really a gangster then, isn’t that so? But I really don’t care. What I care about is that you obviously don’t love me. You didn’t even call me up when you got back home.”    Michael was puffing on his cigarette and some burning ashes fell on Kay’s bare back. She flinched a little and said jokingly, “Stop torturing me, I won’t talk.”    Michael didn’t laugh. His voice sounded absentminded. “You know, when I came home I wasn’t that glad when I saw my family, my father, my mother, my sister Connie, and Tom. It was nice but I didn’t really give a damn. Then I came home tonight and saw you in the kitchen and I was glad. Is that what you mean by love?”    “That’s close enough for me,” Kay said. 
PuzoMTG.txt	648	132.0	1969	Puzo, Mario	The Godfather	  Neri had never much liked Negroes, and working in Harlem had made him like them even less. They all were on drugs or booze while they let their women work or peddle ass. He didn’t have any use for any of the bastards. So Baines’ brazen breaking of the law infuriated him. And the sight of the little girl all cut up with the razor sickened him. Quite coolly, in his own mind, he decided not to bring Baines in.    But witnesses were already crowding into the apartment behind him, some people who lived in the building and his partner from the patrol car.    Neri ordered Baines, “Drop your knife, you’re under arrest.”    Baines laughed. “Man, you gotta use your gun to arrest me.” He held his knife up, “Or maybe you want this.”    Neri moved very quickly, so his partner would not have time to draw a gun. The Negro stabbed with his knife, but Neri’s extraordinary reflexes enabled him to catch the thrust with his left palm. With his right hand he swung the flashlight in a short vicious arc. The blow caught Baines on the side of the head and made his knees buckle comically like a drunk’s. The knife dropped from his hand. He was quite helpless. So Neri’s second blow was inexcusable, as the police departmental hearing and his criminal trial later proved with the help of the testimony of witnesses and his fellow policemen. Neri brought the flashlight down on the top of Baines’ skull in an incredibly powerful blow which shattered the glass of the flashlight; the enamel shield and the bulb itself popping out and flying across the room. The heavy aluminum barrel of the flashlight tube bent and only the batteries inside prevented it from doubling on itself. One awed onlooker, a Negro man who lived in the tenement and later testified against Neri, said, “Man that’s a hard-headed nigger.”    But Baines’ head was not quite hard enough. The blow caved in his skull. He died two hours later in the Harlem Hospital. 
PuzoMTG.txt	680	11520.0	1969	Puzo, Mario	The Godfather	  She had left him because of that lie, not because of the deed. The next morning she had taken the children away with her to her parents’ house in New Hampshire. Without a word to anyone, without really knowing what action she meant to take. Michael had immediately understood. He had called her the first day and then left her alone. It was a week before the limousine from New York pulled up in front of her house with Tom Hagen.    She had spent a long terrible afternoon with Tom Hagen, the most terrible afternoon of her life. They had gone for a walk in the woods outside her little town and Hagen had not been gentle.    Kay had made the mistake of trying to be cruelly flippant, a role to which she was not suited. “Did Mike send you up here to threaten me?” she asked. “I expected to see some of the ‘boys’ get out of the car with their machine guns to make me go back.”    For the first time since she had known him, she saw Hagen angry. He said harshly, “That’s the worst kind of juvenile crap I’ve ever heard. I never expected that from a woman like you. Come on, Kay.”    “All right,” she said. 
PuzoMTG.txt	683	10.0	1969	Puzo, Mario	The Godfather	  Hagen went on. “I’ll give you some more straight talk. After the Don died, Mike was set up to be killed. Do you know who set him up? Tessio. So Tessio had to be killed. Carlo had to be killed. Because treachery can’t be forgiven. Michael could have forgiven it, but people never forgive themselves and so they would always be dangerous. Michael really liked Tessio. He loves his sister. But he would be shirking his duty to you and his children, to his whole family, to me and my family, if he let Tessio and Carlo go free. They would have been a danger to us all, all our lives.”    Kay had been listening to this with tears running down her face. “Is that what Michael sent you up here to tell me?”    Hagen looked at her in genuine surprise. “No,” he said. “He told me to tell you you could have everything you want and do everything you want as long as you take good care of the kids.” Hagen smiled. “He said to tell you that you’re his Don. That’s just a joke.”    Kay put her hand on Hagen’s arm. “He didn’t order you to tell me all the other things?”    Hagen hesitated a moment as if debating whether to tell her a final truth. “You still don’t understand,” he said. “If you told Michael what I’ve told you today, I’m a dead man.” He paused again. “You and the children are the only people on this earth he couldn’t harm.”    It was a long five minutes after that Kay rose from the grass and they started walking back to the house. When they were almost there, Kay said to Hagen, “After supper, can you drive me and the kids to New York in your car?”    “That’s what I came for,” Hagen said. 
PuzoMTG.txt	684	10.0	1969	Puzo, Mario	The Godfather	  A week after she returned to Michael she went to a priest for instruction to become a Catholic.            FROM THE INNERMOST recess of the church the bell tolled for repentance. As she had been taught to do, Kay struck her breast lightly with her clenched hand, the stroke of repentance. The bell tolled again and there was the shuffling of feet as the communicants left their seats to go to the altar rail. Kay rose to join them. She knelt at the altar and from the depths of the church the bell tolled again. With her closed hand she struck her heart once more. The priest was before her. She tilted back her head and opened her mouth to receive the papery thin wafer. This was the most terrible moment of all. Until it melted away and she could swallow and she could do what she came to do.    Washed clean of sin, a favored supplicant, she bowed her head and folded her hands over the altar rail. She shifted her body to make her weight less punishing to her knees.    She emptied her mind of all thought of herself, of her children, of all anger, of all rebellion, of all questions. Then with a profound and deeply willed desire to believe, to be heard, as she had done every day since the murder of Carlo Rizzi, she said the necessary prayers for the soul of Michael Corleone.       
RichSPV.txt	0	322560.0	1740	Richardson, Samuel	Pamela	  PAMELA, or VIRTUE REWARDED          LETTER I      DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,    I have great trouble, and some comfort, to acquaint you with. The  trouble is, that my good lady died of the illness I mentioned to you,  and left us all much grieved for the loss of her; for she was a dear  good lady, and kind to all us her servants. Much I feared, that as I  was taken by her ladyship to wait upon her person, I should be quite  destitute again, and forced to return to you and my poor mother, who  have enough to do to maintain yourselves; and, as my lady's goodness  had put me to write and cast accounts, and made me a little expert at my  needle, and otherwise qualified above my degree, it was not every family  that could have found a place that your poor Pamela was fit for: but  God, whose graciousness to us we have so often experienced at a pinch,  put it into my good lady's heart, on her death-bed, just an hour before  she expired, to recommend to my young master all her servants, one by  one; and when it came to my turn to be recommended, (for I was sobbing  and crying at her pillow) she could only say, My dear son!--and so broke  off a little; and then recovering--Remember my poor Pamela--And these  were some of her last words! O how my eyes run--Don't wonder to see the  paper so blotted. 
RichSPV.txt	1	120.0	1740	Richardson, Samuel	Pamela	  Well, but God's will must be done!--And so comes the comfort, that I  shall not be obliged to return back to be a clog upon my dear parents!  For my master said, I will take care of you all, my good maidens; and  for you, Pamela, (and took me by the hand; yes, he took my hand before  them all,) for my dear mother's sake, I will be a friend to you, and you  shall take care of my linen. God bless him! and pray with me, my dear  father and mother, for a blessing upon him, for he has given mourning  and a year's wages to all my lady's servants; and I having no wages as  yet, my lady having said she should do for me as I deserved, ordered the  housekeeper to give me mourning with the rest; and gave me with his own  hand four golden guineas, and some silver, which were in my old lady's  pocket when she died; and said, if I was a good girl, and faithful and  diligent, he would be a friend to me, for his mother's sake. And so I  send you these four guineas for your comfort; for Providence will not  let me want: And so you may pay some old debt with part, and keep the  other part to comfort you both. If I get more, I am sure it is my duty,  and it shall be my care, to love and cherish you both; for you have  loved and cherished me, when I could do nothing for myself. I send them  by John, our footman, who goes your way: but he does not know what he  carries; because I seal them up in one of the little pill-boxes, which  my lady had, wrapt close in paper, that they mayn't chink; and be sure  don't open it before him. 
RichSPV.txt	69	2.0	1740	Richardson, Samuel	Pamela	  She said afterwards to me, Well, Pamela, you have made our master, from  the sweetest tempered gentleman in the world, one of the most peevish.  But you have it in your power to make him as sweet-tempered as ever;  though I hope you'll never do it on his terms.    This was very good in Mrs. Jervis; but it intimated, that she thought  as ill of his designs as I; and as she knew his mind more than I, it  convinced me that I ought to get away as fast as I could.    My master came in, just now, to speak to Mrs. Jervis about household  matters, having some company to dine with him to-morrow; and I stood up,  and having been crying at his roughness in the entry, I turned away my  face.    You may well, said he, turn away your cursed face; I wish I had never  seen it!--Mrs. Jervis, how long is she to be about this waistcoat?    Sir, said I, if your honour had pleased, I would have taken it with me;  and though it would be now finished in a few hours, I will do so still;  and remove this hated poor Pamela out of your house and sight for ever.    Mrs. Jervis, said he, not speaking to me, I believe this little slut has  the power of witchcraft, if ever there was a witch; for she enchants all  that come near her. She makes even you, who should know better what the  world is, think her an angel of light. 
RichSPV.txt	177	1440.0	1740	Richardson, Samuel	Pamela	  Indeed I might have shewn them his letter to me, as a full confutation  of his to them; but I saw no probability of engaging them in my behalf:  and so thought it signified little, as I was to go away so soon, to  enter more particularly into the matter with them; and besides, I saw  they were not inclinable to let me stay longer, for fear of disobliging  him so I went to bed, but had very little rest: and they would make  their servant-maid bear me company in the chariot five miles, early in  the morning, and she was to walk hack.    I had contrived in my thoughts, when I was on my way in the chariot, on  Friday morning, that when we came into some town to bait, as he must do  for the horses' sake, I would, at the inn, apply myself, if I saw I any  way could, to the mistress of the inn, and tell her the case, and to  refuse to go farther, having nobody but this wicked coachman to contend  with.    Well, I was very full of this project, and in great hopes, some how or  other, to extricate myself in this way. But, oh! the artful wretch had  provided for even this last refuge of mine; for when we came to put up  at a large town on the way, to eat a morsel for dinner, and I was fully  resolved to execute my project, who should be at the inn that he put up  at, but the wicked Mrs. Jewkes, expecting me! And her sister-in-law was  the mistress of it; and she had provided a little entertainment for me. 
RichSPV.txt	193	10.0	1740	Richardson, Samuel	Pamela	    Oh! I am out of my wits for joy! Just as I have got my shoes on, I  am told John, honest John, is come on horseback!--A blessing on his  faithful heart! What joy is this! But I'll tell you more by and by. I  must not let her know I am so glad to see this dear blessed John, to be  sure!--Alas! but he looks sad, as I see him out of the window! What can  be the matter!--I hope my dear parents are well, and Mrs. Jervis, and  Mr. Longman, and every body, my naughty master not excepted;--for I wish  him to live and repent of all his wickedness to poor me.    O dear heart! what a world do we live in!--I am now come to take up my  pen again: But I am in a sad taking truly! Another puzzling trial, to be  sure.      Here was John, as I said, and the poor man came to me, with Mrs. Jewkes,  who whispered, that I would say nothing about the shoes, for my own  sake, as she said. The poor man saw my distress, by my red eyes, and my  hagged looks, I suppose; for I have had a sad time of it, you must needs  think; and though he would have hid it, if he could, yet his own eyes  ran over. Oh, Mrs. Pamela; said he; Oh, Mrs. Pamela!
RichSPV.txt	258	60.0	1740	Richardson, Samuel	Pamela	  I heeded not her reflections; but as I have been used to causes for  mistrusts, I cannot help saying, that I don't like this thing: And their  taking his letters most alarms me.--How happy it was they missed my  packet! I knew not what to think of it!--But why should I let every  accident break my peace? Yet it will do so, while I stay here.    Mrs. Jewkes is mightily at me, to go with her in the chariot, to visit  Mr. Williams. She is so officious to bring on the affair between us,  that, being a cunning, artful woman, I know not what to make of it: I  have refused her absolutely; urging, that except I intended to encourage  his suit, I ought not to do it. And she is gone without me.    I have strange temptations to get away in her absence, for all these  fine appearances. 'Tis sad to have nobody to advise with!--I know not  what to do. But, alas for me! I have no money, if I should, to buy any  body's civilities, or to pay for necessaries or lodgings. But I'll go  into the garden, and resolve afterwards----      I have been in the garden, and to the back-door: and there I stood, my  heart up at my mouth. I could not see I was watched; so this looks  well. But if any thing should go bad afterwards, I should never forgive  myself, for not taking this opportunity. Well, I will go down again,  and see if all is clear, and how it looks out at the back-door in the  pasture. 
RichSPV.txt	279	15.0	1740	Richardson, Samuel	Pamela	What business, said she, had you to read my letter? and snatched it from  me. You see, said she, looking upon it, it says Mrs. Jewkes, at top:  You ought, in manners, to have read no further. O add not, said I, to my  afflictions! I shall be soon out of all your ways! This is too much! too  much! I never can support this--and threw myself upon the couch, in my  closet, and wept most bitterly. She read it in the next room, and came  in again afterwards. Why, this, said she, is a sad letter indeed: I am  sorry for it: But I feared you would carry your niceties too far!--Leave  me, leave me, Mrs. Jewkes, said I, for a while: I cannot speak nor  talk.--Poor heart! said she; Well, I'll come up again presently, and  hope to find you better. But here, take your own letter; I wish you  well; but this is a sad mistake! And so she put down by me that which  was intended for me: But I have no spirit to read it at present. O man!  man! hard-hearted, cruel man! what mischiefs art thou not capable of,  unrelenting persecutor as thou art! 
RichSPV.txt	340	300.0	1740	Richardson, Samuel	Pamela	Williams. Mrs. Jewkes says, he is confined still, and takes on much. All  his trouble is brought upon him for my sake: This grieves me much. My  master, it seems, will have his money from him. This is very hard; for  it is three fifty pounds, he gave him, as he thought, as a salary  for three years that he has been with him: but there was no agreement  between them; and he absolutely depended on my master's favour. To be  sure, it was the more generous of him to run these risks for the sake  of oppressed innocence: and I hope he will meet with his reward in  due time. Alas for me! I dare not plead for him; that would raise my  oppressor's jealousy more. And I have not interest to save myself!      Sunday evening.    Mrs. Jewkes has received a line from my master: I wonder what it is, for  his chariot is come home without him. But she will tell me nothing; so  it is in vain to ask her. I am so fearful of plots and tricks, I know  not what to do!--Every thing I suspect; for, now my disgrace is avowed,  what can I think!--To be sure, the worst will be attempted! I can only  pour out my soul in prayer to God, for his blessed protection. But, if  I must suffer, let me not be long a mournful survivor!--Only let me not  shorten my own time sinfully!----    This woman left upon the table, in the chamber, this letter of my  master's to her; and I bolted myself in, till I had transcribed it. 
RichSPV.txt	427	5.0	1740	Richardson, Samuel	Pamela	  But yet, after all, this last goodness of his has touched me too  sensibly. I wish I had not heard it, almost; and yet, methinks, I am  glad I did; for I should rejoice to think the best of him, for his own  sake.    Well, and so I went out to the chariot, the same that brought me down.  So, Mr. Robert, said I, here I am again! a poor sporting-piece for the  great! a mere tennis-ball of fortune! You have your orders, I hope. Yes,  madam, said he. Pray, now, said I, don't madam me, nor stand with your  hat off to such a one as I. Had not my master, said he, ordered me not  to be wanting in respect to you, I would have shewn you all I could.  Well, said I, with my heart full, that's very kind, Mr. Robert.    Mr. Colbrand, mounted on horseback, with pistols before him, came up to  me, as soon as I got in, with his hat off too. What, monsieur! said I,  are you to go with me?--Part of the way, he said, to see you safe. I  hope that's kind too, in you, Mr. Colbrand, said I.    I had nobody to wave my handkerchief to now, nor to take leave of; and  so I resigned myself to my contemplations, with this strange wayward  heart of mine, that I never found so ungovernable and awkward before. 
RichSPV.txt	428	300.0	1740	Richardson, Samuel	Pamela	  So away drove the chariot!--And when I had got out of the elm-walk, and  into the great road, I could hardly think but I was in a dream all the  time. A few hours before, in my master's arms almost, with twenty kind  things said to me, and a generous concern for the misfortunes he had  brought upon me; and only by one rash half-word exasperated against  me, and turned out of doors, at an hour's warning; and all his kindness  changed to hate! And I now, from three o'clock to five, several miles  off! But if I am going to you, all will be well again, I hope.    Lack-a-day, what strange creatures are men! gentlemen, I should say,  rather! For, my dear deserving good mother, though poverty be both your  lots, has had better hap, and you are, and have always been, blest in  one another!--Yet this pleases me too; he was so good, he would not let  Mrs. Jewkes speak ill of me, and scorned to take her odious unwomanly  advice. O, what a black heart has this poor wretch! So I need not rail  against men so much; for my master, bad as I have thought him, is not  half so bad as this woman.--To be sure she must be an atheist!--Do you  think she is not?    We could not reach further than this little poor place and sad alehouse,  rather than inn; for it began to be dark, and Robin did not make so much  haste as he might have done; and he was forced to make hard shift for  his horses. 
RichSPV.txt	536	150.0	1740	Richardson, Samuel	Pamela	  My poor father did not know I went up to dress myself; and he said his  heart misgave him when he saw me first, for fear I was made a fool of,  and that here was some fine lady that was to be my master's true wife.  And he stood in admiration, and said, O, my dear child, how well will  you become your happy condition! Why you look like a lady already! I  hope, my dear father, said I, and boldly kissed him, I shall always be  your dutiful daughter, whatever my condition be.    My master sent me word he was ready; and when he saw me, said, Dress as  you will, Pamela, you're a charming girl! and so handed me to the  coach, and would make my father and me sit both on the foreside, and sat  backwards, over against me; and bid the coachman drive to the meadow;  that is, where he once met Mr. Williams.    The conversation was most agreeable to me, and to my dear father, as  we went; and he more and more exceeded in goodness and generosity; and,  while I was gone up to dress, he had presented my father with twenty  guineas; desiring him to buy himself and my mother such apparel as they  should think proper; and lay it all out: but I knew not this till after  we came home; my father having had no opportunity to tell me of it. 
RichSPV.txt	624	2.0	1740	Richardson, Samuel	Pamela	He said, He would have me send you a letter to acquaint you with my  nuptials; and, as he could make business that way, Thomas should carry  it purposely, as to-morrow. Nor will I, said he, my dear Pamela, desire  to see your writings, because I told you I would not; for now I will, in  every thing, religiously keep my word with my dear spouse: (O the dear  delightful word!) and you may send all your papers to them, from those  they have, down to this happy moment; only let me beg they will preserve  them, and let me have them when they have read them; as also those I  have not seen; which, however, I desire not to see till then; but then  shall take it for a favour, if you will grant it.    It will be my pleasure, as well as my duty, sir, said I, to obey you  in every thing: and I will write up to the conclusion of this day, that  they may see how happy you have made me. 
RichSPV.txt	710	3.0	1740	Richardson, Samuel	Pamela	  Well, said he, but did you wait upon her? Would you have had me,  sir? said I.--Only, Pamela, replied he, if you did, and knew not what  belonged to your character, as my wife, I shall be very angry with you.  Sir, said I, I did not, but refused it, out of consideration to the  dignity you have raised me to; else, sir, I could have waited on my  knees upon your sister.    Now, said he, you confirm my opinion of your prudence and judgment. She  is an insolent woman, and shall dearly repent it. But, sir, she is to be  excused, because she won't believe I am indeed married; so don't be too  angry at her ladyship.    He said, Ladies, pray don't let us keep you from the company; I'll only  ask a question or two more, and attend you. Said Lady Jones, I so much  long to hear this story of poor madam's persecution, that, if it was  not improper, I should be glad to stay. Miss Darnford would stay for the  same reason; my master saying, He had no secrets to ask; and that it was  kind of them to interest themselves in my grievances.    But Lady Darnford went into the company, and told them the cause of my  detention; for, it seems, my dear master loved me too well, to keep to  himself the disappointment my not being here to receive him, was to  him; and they had all given the two Misses Boroughs and Mr. Perry,  the Stamford guests, such a character of me, that they said they were  impatient to see me. 
RichSPV.txt	891	1051200.0	1740	Richardson, Samuel	Pamela	They arrived at their daughter's house on Tuesday evening in the  following week, and were received by her with the utmost joy and duty;  and with great goodness and complaisance by Mr. B----. And having  resided there till every thing was put in order for them at the Kentish  estate, they were carried down thither by himself, and their daughter,  and put into possession of the pretty farm he had designed for them.    The reader will here indulge us in a few brief observations, which  naturally result from the story and characters; and which will serve  as so many applications of its most material incidents to the minds of  YOUTH of BOTH SEXES.    First, then, in the character of the GENTLEMAN, may be seen that of a  fashionable libertine, who allowed himself in the free indulgence of his  passions, especially to the fair sex; and found himself supported in  his daring attempts, by an affluent fortune in possession, a personal  bravery, as it is called, readier to give than take offence, and an  imperious will: yet as he betimes sees his errors, and reforms in the  bloom of youth, an edifying lesson may be drawn from it, for the use  of such as are born to large fortunes; and who may be taught, by his  example, the inexpressible difference between the hazards and remorse  which attend a profligate course of life, and the pleasures which flow  from virtuous love, and benevolent actions.

From the same good example, let children see what a blessing awaits  their duty to their parents, though ever so low in the world; and that  the only disgrace, is to be dishonest; but none at all to be poor.    From the economy she purposes to observe in her elevation, let even  ladies of condition learn, that there are family employments, in which  they may and ought to make themselves useful, and give good examples to  their inferiors, as well as equals: and that their duty to God,  charity to the poor and sick, and the different branches of household  management, ought to take up the most considerable portions of their  time.    From her signal veracity, which she never forfeited, in all the  hardships she was tried with, though her answers, as she had reason to  apprehend, would often make against her; and the innocence she preserved  throughout all her stratagems and contrivances to save herself from  violation: Persons, even sorely tempted, may learn to preserve a sacred  regard to truth; which always begets a reverence for them, even in the  corruptest minds.

And the  Editor of these sheets will have his end, if it inspires a laudable  emulation in the minds of any worthy persons, who may thereby entitle  themselves to the rewards, the praises, and the blessings, by which  PAMELA was so deservedly distinguished.

HE man who made the  Time Machine — the man I  shall call the Time Traveller  — was well known in scientific circles  a few years since, and the fact of his  disappearance is also well known.  He was a mathematician of peculiar  subtlety, and one of our most conspicuous  investigators in molecular  physics. He did not confine himself  to abstract science. Several ingenious,  and one or two profitable, patents  were his : very profitable they were,  these last, as his handsome house at  Richmond testified. To those who    2 THE TIME MACHINE.    were his intimates, however, his  scientific investigations were as nothing  to his gift of speech. In the  after dinner hours he was ever a  vivid and variegated talker, and at  times his fantastic, often paradoxical,  conceptions came so thick and close  as to form one continuous discourse.  At these times he was as unlike the  popular conception of a scientific investigator  as a man could be. His  cheeks would flush, his eyes grow  bright ; and the stranger the ideas  that sprang and crowded in his  brain, the happier and the more  animated would be his exposition.  Up to the last there was held at  his house a kind of informal gathering,  which it was my privilege to attend,  and where, at one time or  another, I have met most of our distinguished  literary and scientific men.  There was a plain dinner at seven.

At first the conversation  was mere fragmentary chatter, with  some local lacunce of digestive  silence ; but toward nine or half past  nine, if the god was favourable, some  particular topic would triumph by a  kind of natural selection, and would  become the common interest. So it  was, I remember, on the last Thursday  but one of all — the Thursday  when I first heard of the Time  Machine.    I had been jammed in a corner  with a gentleman who shall be disguised  as Filby. He had been running  down Milton — the public neglects  poor Filby's little verses shockingly  ; and as I could think of  nothing but the relative status of  Filby and the man he criticised, and  was much too timid to discuss that,  the arrival of that moment of fusion,  when our several conversations were  suddenly merged into a general discussion,  was a great relief to me.    4 THE TIME MACHINE.    " What's that is nonsense ?" said a  well-known Medical Man, speaking  across Filby to the Psychologist.    " He thinks, " said the Psychologist,  "that Time's only a kind of  Space."    " It's not thinking, " said the Time  Traveller ; "it's knowledge."    "fFoppish affectation, " said Filby,  still harping upon his wrongs ; but  I feigned a great interest in this  question of Space and Time.

I was naturally most occupied  with the growing crowd of little  people, and with the big open portals  that yawned before me shadowy and  mysterious. My general impression  of the world I saw over their heads  was of a tangled waste of beautiful  bushes and flowers, a long neglected  and yet weedless garden. I saw  a number of tall spikes of strange  white flowers, measuring a foot perhaps  across the spread of the waxen  petals. They grew scattered, as if  wild, among the variegated shrubs,  but, as I say, I did not examine them  closely at this time. The Time  Machine was left deserted on the  turf among the rhododendrons.

A  little way up the hill, for instance,  was a great heap of granite, bound  together by masses of aluminium, a  vast labyrinth of precipitous walls  and crumbled heaps, amid which  were thick heaps of very beautiful  pagoda like plants — nettles possibly,  but wonderfully tinted with brown  about the leaves, and incapable of  stinging. It was evidently the derelict  remains of some vast structure,  built to what end I could not determine.  It was here that I was destined,  at a later date, to have a very  strange experience — the first intimation  of a still stranger discovery —  but of that I will speak in its proper  place.    " Looking round, with a sudden  thought, from a terrace on which I had  rested for a while, I realised that there  were no small houses to be seen.  Apparently the single house, and  possibly even the household, had    66 THE TIME MACHINE.    vanished.

I thought I heard something  stir inside — to be explicit, I thought  I heard a sound like a chuckle — but    THE MACHINE IS LOST. 89    I must have been mistaken. Then I  got a big pebble from the river, and  came and hammered till I had flattened  a coil in the decorations, and  the verdegris came off in powdery  flakes. The delicate little people  must have heard me hammering in  gusty outbreaks a mile away on either  hand, but nothing came of it. I saw  a crowd of them upon the slopes,  looking furtively at me. At last, hot  and tired, I sat down to watch the  place. But I was too restless to  watch long, and, besides, I am too  Occidental for a long vigil. I could  work at a problem for years, but to  wait inactive for twenty-four hours —  that is another matter.    ** I got up after a time, and began  walking aimlessly through the bushes  toward the hill again.

Instead were these  frail creatures who had forgotten  their high ancestry, and the white  animals of which I went in fear.  Then I thought of the great fear  there was between these two species,  and for the first time, with a sudden  shiver, came the clear knowledge of  what the meat I had seen might be.  Yet it was too horrible ! I looked at  little Weena sleeping beside me, her  face white and starlike under the  stars, and forthwith dismissed the  thought from my mind.

For all I  knew I might be facing back toward  the Palace of Green Porcelain.    "I found myself in a cold perspiration.  I had to think rapidly what to  do.

Presently I noticed how dry was  some of the foliage above me, for  since I had arrived on the Time  Machine, a matter of a week, no rain  had fallen. So instead of casting  about among the trees for fallen  twigs I began leaping up and dragging  down branches. Very soon I  had a choking smoky fire of green  wood and dry sticks, and could save  my other lumps of camphor.

For a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and  trouble, by the parish surgeon, it remained a matter of considerable  doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all; in which  case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never  have appeared; or, if they had, that being comprised within a couple of  pages, they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the  most concise and faithful specimen of biography, extant in the  literature of any age or country. 
DickCOT.txt	1	3.25	1838	Dickens, Charles	Oliver Twist	  Although I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a  workhouse, is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance  that can possibly befall a human being, I do mean to say that in this  particular instance, it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could  by possibility have occurred. The fact is, that there was considerable  difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of  respiration,--a troublesome practice, but one which custom has rendered  necessary to our easy existence; and for some time he lay gasping on a  little flock mattress, rather unequally poised between this world and  the next: the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter. Now,  if, during this brief period, Oliver had been surrounded by careful  grandmothers, anxious aunts, experienced nurses, and doctors of  profound wisdom, he would most inevitably and indubitably have been  killed in no time. There being nobody by, however, but a pauper old  woman, who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer;  and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract; Oliver and  Nature fought out the point between them. The result was, that, after  a few struggles, Oliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded to advertise  to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been  imposed upon the parish, by setting up as loud a cry as could  reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been  possessed of that very useful appendage, a voice, for a much longer  space of time than three minutes and a quarter.

Having witnessed the little dispute  between Mr. Gamfield and the donkey, he smiled joyously when that  person came up to read the bill, for he saw at once that Mr. Gamfield  was exactly the sort of master Oliver Twist wanted. Mr. Gamfield  smiled, too, as he perused the document; for five pounds was just the  sum he had been wishing for; and, as to the boy with which it was  encumbered, Mr. Gamfield, knowing what the dietary of the workhouse  was, well knew he would be a nice small pattern, just the very thing  for register stoves. So, he spelt the bill through again, from  beginning to end; and then, touching his fur cap in token of humility,  accosted the gentleman in the white waistcoat.    'This here boy, sir, wot the parish wants to 'prentis,' said Mr.  Gamfield.    'Ay, my man,' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat, with a  condescending smile. 'What of him?'    'If the parish vould like him to learn a right pleasant trade, in a  good 'spectable chimbley-sweepin' bisness,' said Mr. Gamfield, 'I wants  a 'prentis, and I am ready to take him.'    'Walk in,' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. Mr. Gamfield  having lingered behind, to give the donkey another blow on the head,  and another wrench of the jaw, as a caution not to run away in his  absence, followed the gentleman with the white waistcoat into the room  where Oliver had first seen him. 
DickCOT.txt	91	10.0	1838	Dickens, Charles	Oliver Twist	  When the coffee was done, the Jew drew the saucepan to the hob.  Standing, then in an irresolute attitude for a few minutes, as if he  did not well know how to employ himself, he turned round and looked at  Oliver, and called him by his name. He did not answer, and was to all  appearances asleep.    After satisfying himself upon this head, the Jew stepped gently to the  door: which he fastened. He then drew forth: as it seemed to Oliver,  from some trap in the floor: a small box, which he placed carefully on  the table. His eyes glistened as he raised the lid, and looked in.  Dragging an old chair to the table, he sat down; and took from it a  magnificent gold watch, sparkling with jewels.    'Aha!' said the Jew, shrugging up his shoulders, and distorting every  feature with a hideous grin. 'Clever dogs! Clever dogs! Staunch to the  last! Never told the old parson where they were. Never poached upon old  Fagin! And why should they? It wouldn't have loosened the knot, or kept  the drop up, a minute longer. No, no, no! Fine fellows! Fine fellows!'    With these, and other muttered reflections of the like nature, the Jew  once more deposited the watch in its place of safety. At least half a  dozen more were severally drawn forth from the same box, and surveyed  with equal pleasure; besides rings, brooches, bracelets, and other  articles of jewellery, of such magnificent materials, and costly  workmanship, that Oliver had no idea, even of their names. 
DickCOT.txt	130	5.0	1838	Dickens, Charles	Oliver Twist	  'Why, what should he say?' inquired Charley: stopping rather suddenly  in his merriment; for the Dodger's manner was impressive. 'What should  he say?'    Mr. Dawkins whistled for a couple of minutes; then, taking off his hat,  scratched his head, and nodded thrice.    'What do you mean?' said Charley.    'Toor rul lol loo, gammon and spinnage, the frog he wouldn't, and high  cockolorum,' said the Dodger: with a slight sneer on his intellectual  countenance.    This was explanatory, but not satisfactory. Master Bates felt it so;  and again said, 'What do you mean?'    The Dodger made no reply; but putting his hat on again, and gathering  the skirts of his long-tailed coat under his arm, thrust his tongue  into his cheek, slapped the bridge of his nose some half-dozen times in  a familiar but expressive manner, and turning on his heel, slunk down  the court. Master Bates followed, with a thoughtful countenance.    The noise of footsteps on the creaking stairs, a few minutes after the  occurrence of this conversation, roused the merry old gentleman as he  sat over the fire with a saveloy and a small loaf in his hand; a  pocket-knife in his right; and a pewter pot on the trivet. There was a  rascally smile on his white face as he turned round, and looking  sharply out from under his thick red eyebrows, bent his ear towards the  door, and listened. 
DickCOT.txt	234	3.0	1838	Dickens, Charles	Oliver Twist	  Nancy, scarcely looking at the boy, threw him a handkerchief to tie  round his throat; Sikes gave him a large rough cape to button over his  shoulders. Thus attired, he gave his hand to the robber, who, merely  pausing to show him with a menacing gesture that he had that same  pistol in a side-pocket of his great-coat, clasped it firmly in his,  and, exchanging a farewell with Nancy, led him away.    Oliver turned, for an instant, when they reached the door, in the hope  of meeting a look from the girl. But she had resumed her old seat in  front of the fire, and sat, perfectly motionless before it.        CHAPTER XXI    THE EXPEDITION    It was a cheerless morning when they got into the street; blowing and  raining hard; and the clouds looking dull and stormy. The night had  been very wet: large pools of water had collected in the road: and the  kennels were overflowing. There was a faint glimmering of the coming  day in the sky; but it rather aggravated than relieved the gloom of the  scene: the sombre light only serving to pale that which the street  lamps afforded, without shedding any warmer or brighter tints upon the  wet house-tops, and dreary streets. There appeared to be nobody  stirring in that quarter of the town; the windows of the houses were  all closely shut; and the streets through which they passed, were  noiseless and empty. 
DickCOT.txt	243	3.0	1838	Dickens, Charles	Oliver Twist	The house was dark, dismantled: and the all appearance, uninhabited.    Sikes, with Oliver's hand still in his, softly approached the low  porch, and raised the latch. The door yielded to the pressure, and  they passed in together.        CHAPTER XXII    THE BURGLARY    'Hallo!' cried a loud, hoarse voice, as soon as they set foot in the  passage.    'Don't make such a row,' said Sikes, bolting the door. 'Show a glim,  Toby.'    'Aha! my pal!' cried the same voice. 'A glim, Barney, a glim! Show the  gentleman in, Barney; wake up first, if convenient.'    The speaker appeared to throw a boot-jack, or some such article, at the  person he addressed, to rouse him from his slumbers: for the noise of  a wooden body, falling violently, was heard; and then an indistinct  muttering, as of a man between sleep and awake.    'Do you hear?' cried the same voice. 'There's Bill Sikes in the  passage with nobody to do the civil to him; and you sleeping there, as  if you took laudanum with your meals, and nothing stronger. Are you  any fresher now, or do you want the iron candlestick to wake you  thoroughly?'    A pair of slipshod feet shuffled, hastily, across the bare floor of the  room, as this interrogatory was put; and there issued, from a door on  the right hand; first, a feeble candle: and next, the form of the same  individual who has been heretofore described as labouring under the  infirmity of speaking through his nose, and officiating as waiter at  the public-house on Saffron Hill. 
DickCOT.txt	315	2.0	1838	Dickens, Charles	Oliver Twist	  As he drew nearer to this house, a feeling come over him that he had  seen it before. He remembered nothing of its details; but the shape  and aspect of the building seemed familiar to him.    That garden wall! On the grass inside, he had fallen on his knees last  night, and prayed the two men's mercy. It was the very house they had  attempted to rob.    Oliver felt such fear come over him when he recognised the place, that,  for the instant, he forgot the agony of his wound, and thought only of  flight. Flight! He could scarcely stand: and if he were in full  possession of all the best powers of his slight and youthful frame,  whither could he fly? He pushed against the garden-gate; it was  unlocked, and swung open on its hinges. He tottered across the lawn;  climbed the steps; knocked faintly at the door; and, his whole strength  failing him, sunk down against one of the pillars of the little portico.    It happened that about this time, Mr. Giles, Brittles, and the tinker,  were recruiting themselves, after the fatigues and terrors of the  night, with tea and sundries, in the kitchen. Not that it was Mr. 
DickCOT.txt	330	10.0	1838	Dickens, Charles	Oliver Twist	After various exclamations of 'I've  got it now' and 'no, I haven't,' and as many renewals of the walking  and frowning, he at length made a dead halt, and spoke as follows:    'I think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to bully Giles,  and that little boy, Brittles, I can manage it. Giles is a faithful  fellow and an old servant, I know; but you can make it up to him in a  thousand ways, and reward him for being such a good shot besides. You  don't object to that?'    'Unless there is some other way of preserving the child,' replied Mrs.  Maylie.    'There is no other,' said the doctor. 'No other, take my word for it.'    'Then my aunt invests you with full power,' said Rose, smiling through  her tears; 'but pray don't be harder upon the poor fellows than is  indispensably necessary.'    'You seem to think,' retorted the doctor, 'that everybody is disposed  to be hard-hearted to-day, except yourself, Miss Rose. I only hope, for  the sake of the rising male sex generally, that you may be found in as  vulnerable and soft-hearted a mood by the first eligible young fellow  who appeals to your compassion; and I wish I were a young fellow, that  I might avail myself, on the spot, of such a favourable opportunity for  doing so, as the present.'    'You are as great a boy as poor Brittles himself,' returned Rose,  blushing. 
DickCOT.txt	419	60.0	1838	Dickens, Charles	Oliver Twist	  'All in two months!' said Mr. Bumble, filled with dismal thoughts.  'Two months! No more than two months ago, I was not only my own  master, but everybody else's, so far as the porochial workhouse was  concerned, and now!--'    It was too much. Mr. Bumble boxed the ears of the boy who opened the  gate for him (for he had reached the portal in his reverie); and  walked, distractedly, into the street.    He walked up one street, and down another, until exercise had abated  the first passion of his grief; and then the revulsion of feeling made  him thirsty. He passed a great many public-houses; but, at length  paused before one in a by-way, whose parlour, as he gathered from a  hasty peep over the blinds, was deserted, save by one solitary  customer. It began to rain, heavily, at the moment. This determined  him. Mr. Bumble stepped in; and ordering something to drink, as he  passed the bar, entered the apartment into which he had looked from the  street.    The man who was seated there, was tall and dark, and wore a large  cloak. He had the air of a stranger; and seemed, by a certain  haggardness in his look, as well as by the dusty soils on his dress, to  have travelled some distance. He eyed Bumble askance, as he entered,  but scarcely deigned to nod his head in acknowledgment of his  salutation. 
DickCOT.txt	428	3.0	1838	Dickens, Charles	Oliver Twist	  'Then, mind what I told you,' said the matron: 'and be careful to say  as little as you can, or you'll betray us at once.'    Mr. Bumble, who had eyed the building with very rueful looks, was  apparently about to express some doubts relative to the advisability of  proceeding any further with the enterprise just then, when he was  prevented by the appearance of Monks: who opened a small door, near  which they stood, and beckoned them inwards.    'Come in!' he cried impatiently, stamping his foot upon the ground.  'Don't keep me here!'    The woman, who had hesitated at first, walked boldly in, without any  other invitation. Mr. Bumble, who was ashamed or afraid to lag behind,  followed: obviously very ill at ease and with scarcely any of that  remarkable dignity which was usually his chief characteristic.    'What the devil made you stand lingering there, in the wet?' said  Monks, turning round, and addressing Bumble, after he had bolted the  door behind them.    'We--we were only cooling ourselves,' stammered Bumble, looking  apprehensively about him.    'Cooling yourselves!' retorted Monks. 'Not all the rain that ever  fell, or ever will fall, will put as much of hell's fire out, as a man  can carry about with him. You won't cool yourself so easily; don't  think it!'    With this agreeable speech, Monks turned short upon the matron, and  bent his gaze upon her, till even she, who was not easily cowed, was  fain to withdraw her eyes, and turn them towards the ground. 
DickCOT.txt	429	3.0	1838	Dickens, Charles	Oliver Twist	  'This is the woman, is it?' demanded Monks.    'Hem! That is the woman,' replied Mr. Bumble, mindful of his wife's  caution.    'You think women never can keep secrets, I suppose?' said the matron,  interposing, and returning, as she spoke, the searching look of Monks.    'I know they will always keep _one_ till it's found out,' said Monks.    'And what may that be?' asked the matron.    'The loss of their own good name,' replied Monks. 'So, by the same  rule, if a woman's a party to a secret that might hang or transport  her, I'm not afraid of her telling it to anybody; not I! Do you  understand, mistress?'    'No,' rejoined the matron, slightly colouring as she spoke.    'Of course you don't!' said Monks. 'How should you?'    Bestowing something half-way between a smile and a frown upon his two  companions, and again beckoning them to follow him, the man hastened  across the apartment, which was of considerable extent, but low in the  roof. He was preparing to ascend a steep staircase, or rather ladder,  leading to another floor of warehouses above: when a bright flash of  lightning streamed down the aperture, and a peal of thunder followed,  which shook the crazy building to its centre.    'Hear it!' he cried, shrinking back. 'Hear it! Rolling and crashing  on as if it echoed through a thousand caverns where the devils were  hiding from it. I hate the sound!'    He remained silent for a few moments; and then, removing his hands  suddenly from his face, showed, to the unspeakable discomposure of Mr. 
DickCOT.txt	562	15.0	1838	Dickens, Charles	Oliver Twist	  This was an antic fellow, half pedlar and half mountebank, who  travelled about the country on foot to vend hones, strops, razors,  washballs, harness-paste, medicine for dogs and horses, cheap  perfumery, cosmetics, and such-like wares, which he carried in a case  slung to his back. His entrance was the signal for various homely  jokes with the countrymen, which slackened not until he had made his  supper, and opened his box of treasures, when he ingeniously contrived  to unite business with amusement.    'And what be that stoof? Good to eat, Harry?' asked a grinning  countryman, pointing to some composition-cakes in one corner.    'This,' said the fellow, producing one, 'this is the infallible and  invaluable composition for removing all sorts of stain, rust, dirt,  mildew, spick, speck, spot, or spatter, from silk, satin, linen,  cambric, cloth, crape, stuff, carpet, merino, muslin, bombazeen, or  woollen stuff. Wine-stains, fruit-stains, beer-stains, water-stains,  paint-stains, pitch-stains, any stains, all come out at one rub with  the infallible and invaluable composition. If a lady stains her  honour, she has only need to swallow one cake and she's cured at  once--for it's poison. If a gentleman wants to prove this, he has only  need to bolt one little square, and he has put it beyond question--for  it's quite as satisfactory as a pistol-bullet, and a great deal nastier  in the flavour, consequently the more credit in taking it. One penny a  square. With all these virtues, one penny a square!'    There were two buyers directly, and more of the listeners plainly  hesitated. The vendor observing this, increased in loquacity. 
DickCOT.txt	590	3.0	1838	Dickens, Charles	Oliver Twist	  'He hung about, not to come over here afore dark, but he'll be here  soon,' replied Chitling. 'There's nowhere else to go to now, for the  people at the Cripples are all in custody, and the bar of the ken--I  went up there and see it with my own eyes--is filled with traps.'    'This is a smash,' observed Toby, biting his lips. 'There's more than  one will go with this.'    'The sessions are on,' said Kags: 'if they get the inquest over, and  Bolter turns King's evidence: as of course he will, from what he's  said already: they can prove Fagin an accessory before the fact, and  get the trial on on Friday, and he'll swing in six days from this, by  G--!'    'You should have heard the people groan,' said Chitling; 'the officers  fought like devils, or they'd have torn him away. He was down once,  but they made a ring round him, and fought their way along. You should  have seen how he looked about him, all muddy and bleeding, and clung to  them as if they were his dearest friends. I can see 'em now, not able  to stand upright with the pressing of the mob, and draggin him along  amongst 'em; I can see the people jumping up, one behind another, and  snarling with their teeth and making at him; I can see the blood upon  his hair and beard, and hear the cries with which the women worked  themselves into the centre of the crowd at the street corner, and swore  they'd tear his heart out!'    The horror-stricken witness of this scene pressed his hands upon his  ears, and with his eyes closed got up and paced violently to and fro,  like one distracted. 
DickCOT.txt	639	2628000.0	1838	Dickens, Charles	Oliver Twist	  Master Charles Bates, appalled by Sikes's crime, fell into a train of  reflection whether an honest life was not, after all, the best.  Arriving at the conclusion that it certainly was, he turned his back  upon the scenes of the past, resolved to amend it in some new sphere of  action. He struggled hard, and suffered much, for some time; but,  having a contented disposition, and a good purpose, succeeded in the  end; and, from being a farmer's drudge, and a carrier's lad, he is now  the merriest young grazier in all Northamptonshire.    And now, the hand that traces these words, falters, as it approaches  the conclusion of its task; and would weave, for a little longer space,  the thread of these adventures.    I would fain linger yet with a few of those among whom I have so long  moved, and share their happiness by endeavouring to depict it. I would  show Rose Maylie in all the bloom and grace of early womanhood,  shedding on her secluded path in life soft and gentle light, that fell  on all who trod it with her, and shone into their hearts. I would  paint her the life and joy of the fire-side circle and the lively  summer group; I would follow her through the sultry fields at noon, and  hear the low tones of her sweet voice in the moonlit evening walk; I  would watch her in all her goodness and charity abroad, and the smiling  untiring discharge of domestic duties at home; I would paint her and  her dead sister's child happy in their love for one another, and  passing whole hours together in picturing the friends whom they had so  sadly lost; I would summon before me, once again, those joyous little  faces that clustered round her knee, and listen to their merry prattle;  I would recall the tones of that clear laugh, and conjure up the  sympathising tear that glistened in the soft blue eye. These, and a  thousand looks and smiles, and turns of thought and speech--I would  fain recall them every one. 
DickCOT.txt	640	2628000.0	1838	Dickens, Charles	Oliver Twist	  How Mr. Brownlow went on, from day to day, filling the mind of his  adopted child with stores of knowledge, and becoming attached to him,  more and more, as his nature developed itself, and showed the thriving  seeds of all he wished him to become--how he traced in him new traits  of his early friend, that awakened in his own bosom old remembrances,  melancholy and yet sweet and soothing--how the two orphans, tried by  adversity, remembered its lessons in mercy to others, and mutual love,  and fervent thanks to Him who had protected and preserved them--these  are all matters which need not to be told. I have said that they were  truly happy; and without strong affection and humanity of heart, and  gratitude to that Being whose code is Mercy, and whose great attribute  is Benevolence to all things that breathe, happiness can never be  attained.    Within the altar of the old village church there stands a white marble  tablet, which bears as yet but one word: 'AGNES.' There is no coffin  in that tomb; and may it be many, many years, before another name is  placed above it! But, if the spirits of the Dead ever come back to  earth, to visit spots hallowed by the love--the love beyond the  grave--of those whom they knew in life, I believe that the shade of  Agnes sometimes hovers round that solemn nook. I believe it none the  less because that nook is in a Church, and she was weak and erring.

What is this, you will perhaps ask, when compared to the noble estate he has lost at the gaming table? nothing yet Harriot, how many, no less worthy than ourselves are there at this moment, who would look upon even our present situation as enviable; 'tis by reflections of this nature I endeavour to reconcile myself to my fate, and, thank heaven, I am reconciled to it.

O spare then, my dear Harriot    yours on the memory of my unfortunate father. I know they are the effects of your tender affection to me; but they hurt my feelings, I can pity, I can lament his situation; this I can allow you to do; but, indeed you must spare your censures on a conduct, which, though faulty, a daughter ought not to condemn: alas, he suffered most severely his agony his remorse in his last moments would have pierced the most flinty heart. Orlando's behaviour but no words can do it justice 'twas great 'twas noble not a murmur not even a sigh escaped him for his own fate, all his feelings    were for the sufferings of a father whose failings he pitied, and wished to forget he, Harriot, has indeed, a degree of manly fortitude, to which your poor Isabella has no pretensions: my resignation proceeds rather from an indifference for the superfluities of life, from a happy flow of spirits, which has ever led me to look on the bright side of the picture, and let me add, which should indeed have been first mentioned, a firm persuasion, that, the Almighty never wholly forsakes the virtuous, nor lays heavier burdens on any of his creatures, than they are able to bear.

THANK heaven! my dear Lady Bell, my brother is rather better, the fever is abated, but he is still in a miserable way, the doctors, however, say he may possibly live; I am willing to believe    the best, though, alas!

She is no favourite of mine, you know, however, as I had been so long confined to a sick room, I thought a drive for an hour might raise my spirits Lord Templeton as usual was with her, and    is absolutely, if possible, more irresistable than ever you see I can be just though I have given my heart to another; perhaps had her Ladyship not known of my attachment she might not have asked my company, since she fears every woman who presumes to cast an eye upon him has a design upon his heart, which she is determined to conquer or die in the attempt. entre nous I am fully convinced he does not care three straws sor her; but let her Ladyship make this flattering discovery, 'tis no affair of mine.

I cannot say I was under any violent apprehensions, nor he neither I believe; however, as one must get the better of a fright sooner or later, she at length thought    proper to open her languid eyes faintly exclaiming, "Where am I?"  I had very near replied as Scrub does in the Beaux Stratagem, to the same question on a similar occasion. Here, my lady, since this was certainly the stratagem of a Belle, my lord in pity to her weakness forbear to renew the subject we were on before, conscious, I believe, that had more to answer for than the poor wheel.

I have not, yet I confess to you Miss Westbury, but I would give half my estate, could I obtain that happiness are you    serious my lord?

Some days after this friendship was struck up between us, which to be sure tickled my vanity not a little he begun to let it down gradually, by convincing me I was not the only object of his attachment, for he asked if I had ever een so fortunate as to see Miss    Beverly, who lived at Mrs. Bellmour's?  Oh! ho! thought I I now begin to see the foundation on which our great friendship is built, and a very pretty foundation it is seen her my lord, yes, and heard her too, and what is more, have the vanity to imagine she does not behold me with indifference not behold you with indifference, (Sir, cried his lordship, in the finest agitation you can conceive) and pray, my lord interrupting him, is that so ve extraordinary, am I then so gusting an object? if so,    came your lordship to be so taken with me? continued I, (with an expressive smile) he now seemed at a loss to know whether I was in jest or earnest, which was exactly my intention.

Why, then without farther ceremony Miss, I should be glad to know what footing you are upon with Lord Templeton? I am not to learn that he has taken some pains to make you believe a thousand most absurd and ridiculous things; I have very particular reasons for making this enquiry; you cannot surely be such a fool as to fancy he has any    thoughts of marrying you that is out of the question: now had you been wise enough to have treated me with that deference I have a right to, I meant to have made you a very friendly offer; first, however, let me know what it is you really expect from him.  Allow me first, said I, with astonishing calmness, to tell you madam what I expect from you (rising and going to the door) which is, that you will be kind enough to find your way down stairs, as you found the way up.    I really thought the creature would have beat me, Harriot how dare you, cried she (choking with rage) presume to treat a person of my quality with this unheard of insolence?  Because, returned I, that feather quality on which you very justly set so high a value, conscious you have nothing else to boast of, I pay no sort of regard to, when possessed by a being, I have reason to look down upon with contempt.

Did I hear right? said Mr. Douglas; did not the servant mistake your brother's name? did she not call him Rochley? She did, Sir. How then (cried he, with a kind of impatience, a sort of I know not what in his manner) comes yours to be Beverley? pray explain this mystery; I have very particular    reasons for being thus inquisitive. Rochley! good God! can it be? is it in nature? speak, my dear child! and put an end to this suspence.  I was diverted with his emotions, looking upon them as nothing more than his surprise at finding me so much attached to a half brother, which I concluded he now fancied he was, by our names being different; and was preparing to acquaint him with the truth, and why I had taken that of Beverly when Orlando returned to us.    Come, my dear brother, said I smiling, come and help to expound an enigma that seems to puzzle my good friend not a little. I now gave him the reasons which had induced me to adopt what in the end proved so very perplexing. Your name, then, is absolutely Rochley? cried he, with still more energy and expression in his voice and countenance, than we thought the case required. Both your names are Rochley? pardon me, I must ask a few more questions. In what part of England did your father live? what was your mothers maiden name?

Indeed, my dear Orlando, I never thought what had passed between his lordship and me, worth your attention. Besides, would it not have had the appearance of vanity, had I been so impatient to acquaint you with it as not to be able to wait your return, which I every day expected. Had I indeed guessed he was your friend, or even known to you, 'tis possible I might have given him a page now and then in my letters; but pray let    me hear what has passed below since I left you.  First tell me cried he (sweetly taking my hand) does my Isabella wish to find his lordship acquitted?  Nay, my dear brother, that is so odd a question (and I fear, Harriot, I felt something very like a blush rise to my cheek) I vow I hardly know whether I do or not. My lord is nothing to me. I cannot strictly say I have any acquaintance with him, though he has contrived to make all this confusion.    Well, then (replied the sly creature) I may without fear of adding to that confusion, tell you his lordship made but an indifferent kind of a defence our uncle you know, my dear, is not a man to be jested with in such serious matters, especially where the happiness of a lady is at stake, and that lady his darling niece.

Well (cried my brother) what news my lord? have you had    an interview with the agreeable Miss Jane Brown?  First tell me, cried his lordship, what have I to hope? what says your charming sister, did you succeed in pleading my cause? will she deign to see me? to pardon me? to  Not so fast, my good friend, I have said all that could be said in your favour (answered my brother)    Isabella, conscious of her innocence is a good deal hurt at your conduct, she has a proper share of pride my Lord however you may possibly prove a better advocate than I have been.  Shall I then be admitted to the happiness of seeing her, have you my dear Rochley gained that point for me? Ah! if I am so fortunate, I will not dispair!    But I shall (said my brother, interrupting him, and smiling) of ever having my question answered, if you go on at this rate, I ask your lordship once more, have you seen that insernal witch or not?  Step in with me (said my lord) for they were by this time at his door, and you shall hear every particular.

Orlando seems inclined to think, that his Caroline alone merits that character, though I believe he allows his Isabella is intitled to stand second on the list.  Dear creatures! all I ask of Heaven, is that they may continue through life to think of us, as    they do at present; can we flatter ourselves this will be the case, Harriot? I dare not answer that question.  Sir John has not thought fit to take any notice of either of the letters, and as he did not, his silence was taken as consent, this he no doubt expected they did their duty, if he would not follow their example, who can help it?

As for poor Isabella! you know, Harriot, I must follow my lord    and master, his house is in Portman-Square, and I am told superb.

It proved a good  investment, for it was a comfortable and convenient home for the men and  women who afterward occupied it. It has certainly been appreciated by  its occupants, and few have left it without regret. We have always tried  to make it an object lesson of cleanliness and cheerfulness, and I don't  think a man has lived in it for six months without being bettered. It  seemed a good deal of money to put on an old farm-house for farm-hands,  but it proved one of the best investments at Four Oaks, for it kept the  men contented and cheerful workers.          CHAPTER VIII    WE PLAT THE FARM      On Monday I was out by ten o'clock, armed with a surveyor's chain.  Thompson had provided a lot of stakes, and we ran the lines, more or  less straight, in general accord with my sketch plan. We walked,  measured, estimated, and drove stakes until noon. At one o'clock we were  at it again, and by four I was fit to drop from fatigue. Farm work was  new to me, and I was soft as soft. I had, however, got the general lay  of the land, and could, by the help of the plan, talk of its future  subdivisions by numerals,--an arrangement that afterward proved definite  and convenient. We adjourned to the shade of the big black oak on the  knoll, and discussed the work in hand. 
StreJT.txt	54	4320.0	1904	Streeter, John Williams	The fat of the land	  The team, wagon, harness, etc., added $395 to the debit account against  the farm. Polly secured her girl,--a green German who had not been long  enough in America to despise the country.    "She doesn't know a thing about our ways," said Polly, "but Mrs.  Thompson can train her as she likes. If you can spend time enough with  green girls, they are apt to grow to your liking."    On Thursday I saw Anderson and the new team safely started for the farm.  Then Polly, the new girl, and I took train for the most interesting spot  on earth.    Soon after we arrived I lost sight of Polly, who seemed to have business  of her own. I found the mason and his men at work on the cellar wall,  which was almost to the top of the ground. The house was on wheels, and  had made most of its journey. The house mover was in a rage because he  had to put the house on a hole instead of on solid ground, as he had  expected. "I have sent for every stick of timber and every cobbling  block I own, to get this house over that hole; there's no money in this  job for me; you ought to have dug the cellar after the house was  placed," said he.    I made friends with him by agreeing to pay $30 more for the job. The  house was safely placed, and by Saturday night the foundation walls were  finished. 
StreJT.txt	70	60.0	1904	Streeter, John Williams	The fat of the land	Cold weather will be on before we know it. I'm going to take this bull  by the horns. I'll advertise for carpenters in the Sunday papers. Some  of those who apply will be non-union men, and I'll hold them over for a  few days until we see how the cat jumps. If it comes to the worst, we  can get some men to take the place of Thompson and Sam, who are  carpenters, and set them at the tools. I will not let this work stop,  strike or no strike."    "If you put non-union men on you will have to feed and sleep them on the  place. The union will make it hot for them."    "I will take all kinds of care of every man who gives me honest work,  you may be sure."    When I returned to town I sent this "ad." to two papers: "Wanted: Ten  good carpenters to go to the country." The Sunday papers gave a lurid  account of the sentiment of the Carpenters' Union and its sympathetic  attitude toward the striking hoisters. The forecast was that there would  not be a nail driven if the strike were not settled by Tuesday night. 
StreJT.txt	82	90.0	1904	Streeter, John Williams	The fat of the land	Perhaps it  would have been as well to buy smaller ones (many wise people have told  me so), but I was in such a hurry! I wanted to pick apples from these  trees at the first possible moment. I argued that a sturdy  three-year-old would have an advantage over its neighbor that was only  two. However small this advantage, I wanted it in my business--my  business being to make a profitable farm in quick time. The ten acres of  the home lot were to be planted with three hundred Yellow Transparent,  three hundred Duchess of Oldenburg, and one hundred mixed varieties for  home use. I selected the Transparent and the Duchess on account of their  disposition to bear early, and because they are good sellers in a near  market, and because a fruit-wise friend was making money from an  eight-year-old orchard of three thousand of these trees, and advised me  not to neglect them.    My order called for thirty-four hundred three-year-old apple trees of  the highest grade, to be delivered in good condition on the platform at  Exeter for the lump sum of $550. The agreement had been made in August,  and the trees were to be delivered as near the 20th of October as  practicable. Apple trees comprised my entire planting for the autumn of  1895. I wanted to do much other work in that line, but it had to be left  for a more convenient season. Hundreds of fruit trees, shade trees, and  shrubs have since been planted at Four Oaks, but this first setting of  thirty-four hundred apple trees was the most important as well as the  most urgent. 
StreJT.txt	169	1.5	1904	Streeter, John Williams	The fat of the land	  Tom Hamilton, her husband, is a young man who is getting on in the  world. He is clever in his profession, and sure to succeed beyond the  success of most men. He is quiet in manner, but he seems to have a way  of managing his quick, handsome wife, which is something of a surprise  to me, and to her also, I fancy. They are congenial and happy, and their  children are beings to adore. Tom and Kate are to live in town. They are  too young for the joys of country life, and must needs drag on as they  are, loved and admired by a host of friends. They can, and will,  however, spend much time at Four Oaks; and I need not say they approved  our plans.    Jack is our second. He was a junior at Yale, and I am shy of saying much  about him lest I be accused of partiality. Enough to say that he is  tall, blond, handsome, and that he has gentle, winning ways that draw  the love of men and women. He is a dreamer of dreams, but he has a  sturdy drop of Puritan blood in his veins that makes him strong in  conviction and brave in action. Jack has never caused me an hour of  anxiety, and I was ever proud to see him in any company.    Concerning Jane, I must be pardoned in advance for a father's  favoritism. She is my youngest, and to me she seems all that a father  could wish. Of fair height and well moulded, her physique is perfect. 
StreJT.txt	182	480.0	1904	Streeter, John Williams	The fat of the land	  For an hour I watched the big flakes fall; and, as I watched, I dreamed  the dream of peace for all the world. The brazen trumpet of war was a  thing of the past. The white dove of peace had built her nest in the  cannon's mouth and stopped its awful roar. The federation of the world  was secured by universal intelligence and community of interest. Envy  and selfishness and hypocrisy, and evil doing and evil speaking, were  deeply covered by the snowy mantle that brought "peace on earth and good  will to men."    My dream was not dispelled by any rude awakening. As the house threw off  the fetters of the night and gradually struggled into activity, it was  in such a fresh and loving manner and with such thoughtful solicitude  for each member of our world, that I walked in my dream all day.    The snow fell rapidly till noon, and then the sun came forth from the  veil of clouds and cast its southern rays across the white expanse with  an effect that drew exclamations of delight from all who had eyes to  see. No wind stirred the air, but ever and anon a bright avalanche would  slide from bough or bush, sparkle and gleam as the sun caught it, and  then sink gently into the deep lap spread below. The bough would spring  as if to catch its beautiful load, and, failing in this, would throw up  its head and try to look unconcerned,--though quite evidently conscious  of its bereavement. 
StreJT.txt	243	180.0	1904	Streeter, John Williams	The fat of the land	        CHAPTER XLIII    THE RESULT      As soon as the first report of the battle reached me, I telephoned to  Bill Jackson, asking him to come at once to Four Oaks and to bring a man  with him. When he arrived, attended by his big Irishman, my men had  already put one of the farm teams to a great farm wagon, and had filled  the box nearly full of hay. We gave Jackson a hurried account of the  fight and asked him to go at once and offer relief to the wounded,--if  such relief were needed. Jackson was willing enough to go, but he was  greatly disappointed that he had missed the fight; it seemed unnatural  that there should be a big fight in his neighborhood and he not in it.    "I'd give a ten-acre lot to have been with you, lads," said the big  farmer as he started off.    Word had been sent to Dr. High to be ready to care for some broken  heads. Two hours later I drove to the Inn at Exeter and found the doctor  just commencing the work of repair. Thirteen men had been brought in by  the wagon, twelve of them more or less cut and bruised about the head,  and all needing some surgical attention. The thirteenth man was stone  dead. A terrific blow on the back of the head had crushed his skull as  if it had been an egg-shell, and he must have died instantly.
StreJT.txt	317	600.0	1904	Streeter, John Williams	The fat of the land	  As soon as fruit spurs and buds begin to show themselves, the treatment  should be modified, but not remitted. Less nitrogen and more phosphoric  acid and potash are to be used, and the mulch should _not_ be removed  in the early spring. The objects now are, to stimulate the fruit buds  and to retard activity in the roots until the danger from late frosts is  past. As a result of this kind of treatment, many varieties of apple  trees will give moderate crops when the roots are seven, and the trunks  are six years old. Fruit buds showed in abundance on many of my trees in  the fall of 1897, especially on the Duchess and the Yellow Transparent,  and I looked for a small apple harvest that year.          CHAPTER LV    THE OLD TIME FARM-HAND      With all my industries thus increasing, the necessity for more help  became imperative. French and Judson had their hands more than full in  the dairy barns, and had to be helped out by Thompson. Anderson could  not give the swine all the attention they needed, and was assisted by  Otto, who proved an excellent swineherd. Sam had the aid of Lars's boys  with the poultry, and very efficient aid it was, considering the time  they could give to it. They had to be off with the market wagon at 7.40,  and did not return from school until 4 P.M.
StreJT.txt	326	1440.0	1904	Streeter, John Williams	The fat of the land	  I remembered that my friend's pale face had looked a shade paler than  usual the evening before, and that there had been a pinched expression  around the nose and mouth, as if from pain; but Sir Tom had many twinges  from his old enemy, gout, which he did not care to discuss, and I took  little note of his lack of fitness. He touched the brandy bottle a  little oftener than usual, and left for home earlier; but his voice was  as cheery as ever, and we thought only of gout. He was taken with a hard  chill on his way home, which lasted for some time after he was put to  bed; but he would not listen to the requests of William and the faithful  cook that the doctor be summoned. At last he fell into a heavy sleep  from which it was hard to rouse him, and the servants followed their own  desire and called Dr. High. He came as promptly as possible, and did all  that could be done for the sick man.    A hurried examination convinced me that Dr. High's opinion of the  gravity of the case was correct, and we telephoned at once for a  specialist from the city, and for a trained nurse. After a short  consultation with Dr. High I reentered my friend's room, and I fear that  my face gave me away, for Sir Tom said:--    "Be a man, Williams, and tell the whole of it." 
StreJT.txt	335	2.0	1904	Streeter, John Williams	The fat of the land	  "Of course we must, but children are an unknown quantity. They are _x_  in the domestic problem, and we cannot tell what they stand for until  the problem is worked out. I don't see why we can't find the value of  _x_ in the country as easily as in the city. They have had city and  school life, now let them see country life; the _x_ will stand for wide  experience at least."    "Jane likes it thus far," said I, "and I think she will continue; but I  don't feel so sure about Jack."    "You're as blind as a bat--or a man. Jane loves country life because  she's young and growing; but there's a subconscious sense which tells  her that she's simply fitting herself to be carried off by that handsome  giant, Jim Jarvis. She doesn't know it, but it's the truth all the same,  and it will come as sure as tide; and when it does come, her life will  be run into other moulds than we have made, no matter how carefully."    "I wonder where this modern Hercules is most vulnerable. I'll slay him  if I find him mousing around my Jane."    "You will slay nothing, Mr. Headman, and you know it; you will just take  what's coming to you, as others have done since the world was young."    "Well, I give fair warning; it's 'hands off Jane,' for lo, these many  years, or some one will be brewing 'harm tea' for himself." 
StreJT.txt	339	2.0	1904	Streeter, John Williams	The fat of the land	  "She doesn't say much, but I think she wouldn't object."    "Of course she can't object. You sick a big brute of a man on to a  little girl, and she don't dare object; but I'll feed him to the fishes  if he worries her."    "To be sure you will, Mr. Ogre. Anybody would be sure of that to hear  you talk."    "Don't chaff me, Polly. This is a serious business. If you sell my girl,  I'm going to buy a new one. I'll ask Jessie Gordon to go with us and, if  Jack is half the man I take him to be, he'll replenish our stock of  girls before we get back."    "Who is match-making now?"    "I don't care what you call it. I shall take out letters of marque and  reprisal. I won't raise girls to be carried off by the first privateer  that makes sail for them, without making some one else suffer. If  Jarvis goes, Jessie goes, that's flat."    "I think it will be an excellent plan, Mr. Bad Temper, and I've no doubt  that we can manage it."    "Don't say 'we' when you talk of managing it. I tell you I'm entirely on  the defensive until some one robs me, then I'll take what is my  neighbor's if I can get it. If it were not for my promise to Sir Tom, I  wouldn't leave the farm for a minute! And I would establish a quarantine  against all giants for at least five years." 
StreJT.txt	348	360.0	1904	Streeter, John Williams	The fat of the land	  As night came on, great clouds rolled up from the northwest and the wind  increased. Darkness, as of Egypt, fell upon us before we passed the  Lizard, and the only things that showed above the raging waters were the  beacon lights, and these looked dim and far away. Occasionally a flash  of lightning threw the waters into relief, and then made the darkness  more impenetrable. As we steamed beyond the Lizard and the protecting  Cornish coast, the full force of the gale, from out the Irish Sea,  struck us. We were going nearly with it, and the good ship pitched and  reared like an angry horse, but did not roll much. Pitching is harder to  bear than rolling, and the decks were quickly vacated.    I turned into my stateroom soon after ten o'clock, and then happened a  thing which will hold a place in my memory so long as I have one. I did  not feel sleepy, but I was nervous, restless, and half sick. I lay on my  lounge for perhaps half an hour, and then felt impelled to go on deck. I  wrapped myself in a great waterproof ulster, pulled my storm cap over my  ears, and climbed the companionway. Two or three electric bulbs in  sheltered places on deck only served to make the darkness more intense. 
StreJT.txt	379	2.0	1904	Streeter, John Williams	The fat of the land	  I would exchange my age, money, and acres for youth and forty acres, and  think that I had the best of the bargain; and I would start the factory  by planting ten acres of orchard, buying two sows, two cows, and two  setting hens. Youth, strength, and hustle are a great sight better than  money, and the wise youth can have a finer farm than mine before he  passes the half-century mark, even though he have but a bare forty to  begin with.    I do not take it for granted that every man has even a bare forty; but  millions of men who have it not, can have it by a little persistent  self-denial; and when an able-bodied man has forty acres of ground under  his feet, it is up to him whether he will be a comfortable, independent,  self-respecting man or not.    A great deal of farm land is distant from markets and otherwise limited  in its range of production, but nearly every forty which lies east of  the hundredth meridian is competent to furnish a living for a family of  workers, if the workers be intelligent as well as industrious. Farm  lands are each year being brought closer to markets by steam and  electric roads; telephone and telegraphic wires give immediate service;  and the daily distribution of mails brings the producer into close touch  with the consumer. The day of isolation and seclusion has passed, and  the farmer is a personal factor in the market. He is learning the  advantages of cooeperation, both in producing and in disposing of his  wares; he has paid off his mortgage and has money in the bank; he is a  power in politics, and by far the most dependable element in the state. 
StreJT.txt	380	2.0	1904	Streeter, John Williams	The fat of the land	Like the wrestler of old, who gained new strength whenever his foot  touched the ground, our country gains fresh vigor from every man who  takes to the soil.    In preaching a hejira to the country, I do not forget the interests of  the children. Let no one dread country life for the young until they  come to the full pith and stature of maturity; for their chances of  doing things worth doing in the world are four to one against those of  children who are city-bred. Four-fifths of the men and women who do  great things are country-bred. This is out of all proportion to the  birth-rate as between country and city, and one is at a loss to account  for the disproportion, unless it is to be credited to environment. Is it  due to pure air and sunshine, making redder blood and more vigorous  development, to broader horizons and freedom from abnormal conventions?  Or does a close relation to primary things give a newness to mind and  body which is granted only to those who apply in person?    Whatever the reason, it certainly pays to be country-bred. The cities  draw to themselves the cream of these youngsters, which is only natural;  but the cities do not breed them, except as exotics.    If the unborn would heed my advice, I would say, By all means be born in  the country,--in Ohio if possible. But, if fortune does not prove as  kind to you as I could wish, accept this other advice: Choose the,  country for your foster-mother; go to her for consolation and  rejuvenation, take her bounty gratefully, rest on her fair bosom, and be  content with the fat of the land.         
MorrTB.txt	0	1051200.0	1987	Morrison, Toni	Beloved	  124 WAS SPITEFUL. Full of a baby’s venom. The women in the house knew it and so did the children. For years each put up with the spite in his own way, but by 1873 Sethe and her daughter Denver were its only victims. The grandmother, Baby Suggs, was dead, and the sons, Howard and Buglar, had run away by the time they were thirteen years old—as soon as merely looking in a mirror shattered it (that was the signal for Buglar); as soon as two tiny hand prints appeared in the cake (that was it for Howard). Neither boy waited to see more; another kettleful of chickpeas smoking in a heap on the floor; soda crackers crumbled and strewn in a line next to the door-sill. Nor did they wait for one of the relief periods: the weeks, months even, when nothing was disturbed. No. Each one fled at once—the moment the house committed what was for him the one insult not to be borne or witnessed a second time. Within two months, in the dead of winter, leaving their grandmother, Baby Suggs; Sethe, their mother; and their little sister, Denver, all by themselves in the gray and white house on Bluestone Road. It didn’t have a number then, because Cincinnati didn’t stretch that far. In fact, Ohio had been calling itself a state only seventy years when first one brother and then the next stuffed quilt packing into his hat, snatched up his shoes, and crept away from the lively spite the house felt for them. 
MorrTB.txt	1	50400.0	1987	Morrison, Toni	Beloved	  Baby Suggs didn’t even raise her head. From her sickbed she heard them go but that wasn’t the reason she lay still. It was a wonder to her that her grandsons had taken so long to realize that every house wasn’t like the one on Bluestone Road. Suspended between the nastiness of life and the meanness of the dead, she couldn’t get interested in leaving life or living it, let alone the fright of two creeping-off boys. Her past had been like her present—intolerable—and since she knew death was anything but forgetfulness, she used the little energy left her for pondering color.    “Bring a little lavender in, if you got any. Pink, if you don’t.”    And Sethe would oblige her with anything from fabric to her own tongue. Winter in Ohio was especially rough if you had an appetite for color. Sky provided the only drama, and counting on a Cincinnati horizon for life’s principal joy was reckless indeed. So Sethe and the girl Denver did what they could, and what the house permitted, for her. Together they waged a perfunctory battle against the outrageous behavior of that place; against turned-over slop jars, smacks on the behind, and gusts of sour air. For they understood the source of the outrage as well as they knew the source of light. 
MorrTB.txt	21	4.0	1987	Morrison, Toni	Beloved	  “What tree on your back? Is something growing on your back? I don’t see nothing growing on your back.”    “It’s there all the same.”    “Who told you that?”    “Whitegirl. That’s what she called it. I’ve never seen it and never will. But that’s what she said it looked like. A chokecherry tree. Trunk, branches, and even leaves. Tiny little chokecherry leaves. But that was eighteen years ago. Could have cherries too now for all I know.”    Sethe took a little spit from the tip of her tongue with her forefinger. Quickly, lightly she touched the stove. Then she trailed her fingers through the flour, parting, separating small hills and ridges of it, looking for mites. Finding none, she poured soda and salt into the crease of her folded hand and tossed both into the flour. Then she reached into a can and scooped half a handful of lard. Deftly she squeezed the flour through it, then with her left hand sprinkling water, she formed the dough.    “I had milk,” she said. “I was pregnant with Denver but I had milk for my baby girl. I hadn’t stopped nursing her when I sent her on ahead with Howard and Buglar.”    Now she rolled the dough out with a wooden pin. “Anybody could smell me long before he saw me. And when he saw me he’d see the drops of it on the front of my dress. Nothing I could do about that.
MorrTB.txt	25	10.0	1987	Morrison, Toni	Beloved	  The stove didn’t shudder as it adjusted to its heat. Denver wasn’t stirring in the next room. The pulse of red light hadn’t come back and Paul D had not trembled since 1856 and then for eighty-three days in a row. Locked up and chained down, his hands shook so bad he couldn’t smoke or even scratch properly. Now he was trembling again but in the legs this time. It took him a while to realize that his legs were not shaking because of worry, but because the floorboards were and the grinding, shoving floor was only part of it. The house itself was pitching. Sethe slid to the floor and struggled to get back into her dress. While down on all fours, as though she were holding her house down on the ground, Denver burst from the keeping room, terror in her eyes, a vague smile on her lips.    “God damn it! Hush up!” Paul D was shouting, falling, reaching for anchor. “Leave the place alone! Get the hell out!” A table rushed toward him and he grabbed its leg. Somehow he managed to stand at an angle and, holding the table by two legs, he bashed it about, wrecking everything, screaming back at the screaming house. “You want to fight, come on! God damn it! She got enough without you. She got enough!”    The quaking slowed to an occasional lurch, but Paul D did not stop whipping the table around until everything was rock quiet. Sweating and breathing hard, he leaned against the wall in the space the sideboard left. Sethe was still crouched next to the stove, clutching her salvaged shoes to her chest. The three of them, Sethe, Denver, and Paul D, breathed to the same beat, like one tired person. Another breathing was just as tired. 
MorrTB.txt	28	2.0	1987	Morrison, Toni	Beloved	  It was over before they could get their clothes off. Half-dressed and short of breath, they lay side by side resentful of one another and the skylight above them. His dreaming of her had been too long and too long ago. Her deprivation had been not having any dreams of her own at all. Now they were sorry and too shy to make talk.    Sethe lay on her back, her head turned from him. Out of the corner of his eye, Paul D saw the float of her breasts and disliked it, the spread-away, flat roundness of them that he could definitely live without, never mind that downstairs he had held them as though they were the most expensive part of himself. And the wrought-iron maze he had explored in the kitchen like a gold miner pawing through pay dirt was in fact a revolting clump of scars. Not a tree, as she said. Maybe shaped like one, but nothing like any tree he knew because trees were inviting; things you could trust and be near; talk to if you wanted to as he frequently did since way back when he took the midday meal in the fields of Sweet Home. Always in the same place if he could, and choosing the place had been hard because Sweet Home had more pretty trees than any farm around. His choice he called Brother, and sat under it, alone sometimes, sometimes with Halle or the other Pauls, but more often with Sixo, who was gentle then and still speaking English.
MorrTB.txt	71	180.0	1987	Morrison, Toni	Beloved	  One-Ton Lady spit at them, but her bulk shortened her aim and they got a big kick out of the helpless meanness in her little eyes. Arabian Nights Dancer cut her performance to three minutes instead of the usual fifteen she normally did—earning the gratitude of the children, who could hardly wait for Abu Snake Charmer, who followed her.    Denver bought horehound, licorice, peppermint and lemonade at a table manned by a little whitegirl in ladies’ high-topped shoes. Soothed by sugar, surrounded by a crowd of people who did not find her the main attraction, who, in fact, said, “Hey, Denver,” every now and then, pleased her enough to consider the possibility that Paul D wasn’t all that bad. In fact there was something about him—when the three of them stood together watching Midget dance—that made the stares of other Negroes kind, gentle, something Denver did not remember seeing in their faces. Several even nodded and smiled at her mother, no one, apparently, able to withstand sharing the pleasure Paul D was having. He slapped his knees when Giant danced with Midget; when Two-Headed Man talked to himself. He bought everything Denver asked for and much she did not. He teased Sethe into tents she was reluctant to enter. Stuck pieces of candy she didn’t want between her lips. When Wild African Savage shook his bars and said wa wa, Paul D told everybody he knew him back in Roanoke. Paul D made a few acquaintances; spoke to them about what work he might find. Sethe returned the smiles she got. Denver was swaying with delight. And on the way home, although leading them now, the shadows of three people still held hands. 
MorrTB.txt	120	5.0	1987	Morrison, Toni	Beloved	  “There you go, Lu. Jesus looking at you.”    Sethe was looking at one mile of dark water, which would have to be split with one oar in a useless boat against a current dedicated to the Mississippi hundreds of miles away. It looked like home to her, and the baby (not dead in the least) must have thought so too. As soon as Sethe got close to the river her own water broke loose to join it. The break, followed by the redundant announcement of labor, arched her back.    “What you doing that for?” asked Amy. “Ain’t you got a brain in your head? Stop that right now. I said stop it, Lu. You the dumbest thing on this here earth. Lu! Lu!”    Sethe couldn’t think of anywhere to go but in. She waited for the sweet beat that followed the blast of pain. On her knees again, she crawled into the boat. It waddled under her and she had just enough time to brace her leaf-bag feet on the bench when another rip took her breath away. Panting under four summer stars, she threw her legs over the sides, because here come the head, as Amy informed her as though she did not know it—as though the rip was a breakup of walnut logs in the brace, or of lightning’s jagged tear through a leather sky.    It was stuck. Face up and drowning in its mother’s blood. Amy stopped begging Jesus and began to curse His daddy. 
MorrTB.txt	167	30240.0	1987	Morrison, Toni	Beloved	  The next evening he did it again and then again. He was accustomed to sex with Sethe just about every day, and to avoid the confusion Beloved’s shining caused him he still made it his business to take her back upstairs in the morning, or lie down with her after supper. But he found a way and a reason to spend the longest part of the night in the rocker. He told himself it must be his back—something supportive it needed for a weakness left over from sleeping in a box in Georgia.    It went on that way and might have stayed that way but one evening, after supper, after Sethe, he came downstairs, sat in the rocker and didn’t want to be there. He stood up and realized he didn’t want to go upstairs either. Irritable and longing for rest, he opened the door to Baby Suggs’ room and dropped off to sleep on the bed the old lady died in. That settled it—so it seemed. It became his room and Sethe didn’t object—her bed made for two had been occupied by one for eighteen years before Paul D came to call. And maybe it was better this way, with young girls in the house and him not being her true-to-life husband. In any case, since there was no reduction in his before-breakfast or after-supper appetites, he never heard her complain. 
MorrTB.txt	193	10.0	1987	Morrison, Toni	Beloved	  Can you stitch this up for me, baby?    Um hm. Soon’s I finish this petticoat. She just got the one she came here in and everybody needs a change.    Any pie left?    I think Denver got the last of it.    And not complaining, not even minding that he slept all over and around the house now, which she put a stop to this night out of courtesy.    Sethe sighed and placed her hand on his chest. She knew she was building a case against him in order to build a case against getting pregnant, and it shamed her a little. But she had all the children she needed. If her boys came back one day, and Denver and Beloved stayed on—well, it would be the way it was supposed to be, no? Right after she saw the shadows holding hands at the side of the road hadn’t the picture altered? And the minute she saw the dress and shoes sitting in the front yard, she broke water. Didn’t even have to see the face burning in the sunlight. She had been dreaming it for years.    Paul D’s chest rose and fell, rose and fell under her hand.            DENVER FINISHED washing the dishes and sat down at the table. Beloved, who had not moved since Sethe and Paul D left the room, sat sucking her forefinger. Denver watched her face awhile and then said, “She likes him here.”    Beloved went on probing her mouth with her finger. “Make him go away,” she said. 
MorrTB.txt	199	1080.0	1987	Morrison, Toni	Beloved	  It made them furious. They swallowed baking soda, the morning after, to calm the stomach violence caused by the bounty, the reckless generosity on display at 124. Whispered to each other in the yards about fat rats, doom and uncalled-for pride.    The scent of their disapproval lay heavy in the air. Baby Suggs woke to it and wondered what it was as she boiled hominy for her grandchildren. Later, as she stood in the garden, chopping at the tight soil over the roots of the pepper plants, she smelled it again. She lifted her head and looked around. Behind her some yards to the left Sethe squatted in the pole beans. Her shoulders were distorted by the greased flannel under her dress to encourage the healing of her back. Near her in a bushel basket was the three-week-old baby. Baby Suggs, holy, looked up. The sky was blue and clear. Not one touch of death in the definite green of the leaves. She could hear birds and, faintly, the stream way down in the meadow. The puppy, Here Boy, was burying the last bones from yesterday’s party. From somewhere at the side of the house came the voices of Buglar, Howard and the crawling girl. Nothing seemed amiss—yet the smell of disapproval was sharp. Back beyond the vegetable garden, closer to the stream but in full sun, she had planted corn. Much as they’d picked for the party, there were still ears ripening, which she could see from where she stood.
MorrTB.txt	246	10.0	1987	Morrison, Toni	Beloved	  Those twenty-eight happy days were followed by eighteen years of disapproval and a solitary life. Then a few months of the sun-splashed life that the shadows holding hands on the road promised her; tentative greetings from other coloredpeople in Paul D’s company; a bed life for herself. Except for Denver’s friend, every bit of it had disappeared. Was that the pattern? she wondered. Every eighteen or twenty years her unlivable life would be interrupted by a short-lived glory?    Well, if that’s the way it was—that’s the way it was.    She had been on her knees, scrubbing the floor, Denver trailing her with the drying rags, when Beloved appeared saying, “What these do?” On her knees, scrub brush in hand, she looked at the girl and the skates she held up. Sethe couldn’t skate a lick but then and there she decided to take Baby Suggs’ advice: lay it all down. She left the bucket where it was. Told Denver to get out the shawls and started searching for the other skates she was certain were in that heap somewhere. Anybody feeling sorry for her, anybody wandering by to peep in and see how she was getting on (including Paul D) would discover that the woman junkheaped for the third time because she loved her children—that woman was sailing happily on a frozen creek.    Hurriedly, carelessly she threw the shoes about. She found one blade—a man’s. 
MorrTB.txt	270	360.0	1987	Morrison, Toni	Beloved	  “Don’t talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don’t say nothing to me this morning.”    “What? What? What? You talking back to me?”    “I’m telling you don’t say nothing to me.”    “You better get them pies made.”    Sethe touched the fruit and picked up the paring knife.    When pie juice hit the bottom of the oven and hissed, Sethe was well into the potato salad. Sawyer came in and said, “Not too sweet. You make it too sweet they don’t eat it.”    “Make it the way I always did.”    “Yeah. Too sweet.”    None of the sausages came back. The cook had a way with them and Sawyer’s Restaurant never had leftover sausage. If Sethe wanted any, she put them aside soon as they were ready. But there was some passable stew. Problem was, all her pies were sold too. Only rice pudding left and half a pan of gingerbread that didn’t come out right. Had she been paying attention instead of daydreaming all morning, she wouldn’t be picking around looking for her dinner like a crab. She couldn’t read clock time very well, but she knew when the hands were closed in prayer at the top of the face she was through for the day. She got a metal-top jar, filled it with stew and wrapped the gingerbread in butcher paper. These she dropped in her outer skirt pockets and began washing up. None of it was anything like what the cook and the two waiters walked off with.

Seems to me like you ought to show it some respect, you follow me?”    “Yes, sir,” said Stamp. “You right about that. That’s just what I come over to talk to him about. Just that.”    The rider clicked his tongue and trotted off. Stamp made small circles in the palm of his left hand with two fingers of his right. “You got to choose,” he said. “Choose anyone. They let you be if you want em to. My house. Ella. Willie Pike. None of us got much, but all of us got room for one more. Pay a little something when you can, don’t when you can’t. Think about it. You grown. I can’t make you do what you won’t, but think about it.”    Paul D said nothing.    “If I did you harm, I’m here to rectify it.”    “No need for that. No need at all.”    A woman with four children walked by on the other side of the road. She waved, smiling. “Hoo-oo. I can’t stop. See you at meeting.”    “I be there,” Stamp returned her greeting. “There’s another one,” he said to Paul D. “Scripture Woodruff, Able’s sister. Works at the brush and tallow factory. You’ll see.

MorrTB.txt	396	525600.0	1987	Morrison, Toni	Beloved	          They forgot her like a bad dream. After they made up their tales, shaped and decorated them, those that saw her that day on the porch quickly and deliberately forgot her. It took longer for those who had spoken to her, lived with her, fallen in love with her, to forget, until they realized they couldn’t remember or repeat a single thing she said, and began to believe that, other than what they themselves were thinking, she hadn’t said anything at all. So, in the end, they forgot her too. Remembering seemed unwise. They never knew where or why she crouched, or whose was the underwater face she needed like that. Where the memory of the smile under her chin might have been and was not, a latch latched and lichen attached its apple-green bloom to the metal. What made her think her fingernails could open locks the rain rained on?            It was not a story to pass on.            So they forgot her. Like an unpleasant dream during a troubling sleep. Occasionally, however, the rustle of a skirt hushes when they wake, and the knuckles brushing a cheek in sleep seem to belong to the sleeper. Sometimes the photograph of a close friend or relative—looked at too long—shifts, and something more familiar than the dear face itself moves there. They can touch it if they like, but don’t, because they know things will never be the same if they do. 
MorrTB.txt	397	40320.0	1987	Morrison, Toni	Beloved	          This is not a story to pass on.            Down by the stream in back of 124 her footprints come and go, come and go. They are so familiar. Should a child, an adult place his feet in them, they will fit. Take them out and they disappear again as though nobody ever walked there.    By and by all trace is gone, and what is forgotten is not only the footprints but the water too and what it is down there. The rest is weather. Not the breath of the disremembered and unaccounted for, but wind in the eaves, or spring ice thawing too quickly. Just weather. Certainly no clamor for a kiss. 
CollWTM.txt	0	40320.0	1868	Collins, Wilkie	The Moonstone	PROLOGUE    THE STORMING OF SERINGAPATAM (1799)      Extracted from a Family Paper      I address these lines--written in India--to my relatives in England.    My object is to explain the motive which has induced me to refuse the  right hand of friendship to my cousin, John Herncastle. The reserve  which I have hitherto maintained in this matter has been misinterpreted  by members of my family whose good opinion I cannot consent to forfeit.  I request them to suspend their decision until they have read my  narrative. And I declare, on my word of honour, that what I am now about  to write is, strictly and literally, the truth.    The private difference between my cousin and me took its rise in a  great public event in which we were both concerned--the storming of  Seringapatam, under General Baird, on the 4th of May, 1799.    In order that the circumstances may be clearly understood, I must  revert for a moment to the period before the assault, and to the stories  current in our camp of the treasure in jewels and gold stored up in the  Palace of Seringapatam.        II      One of the wildest of these stories related to a Yellow Diamond--a  famous gem in the native annals of India. 
CollWTM.txt	1	241920.0	1868	Collins, Wilkie	The Moonstone	  The earliest known traditions describe the stone as having been set in  the forehead of the four-handed Indian god who typifies the Moon. Partly  from its peculiar colour, partly from a superstition which represented  it as feeling the influence of the deity whom it adorned, and growing  and lessening in lustre with the waxing and waning of the moon, it  first gained the name by which it continues to be known in India to  this day--the name of THE MOONSTONE. A similar superstition was once  prevalent, as I have heard, in ancient Greece and Rome; not applying,  however (as in India), to a diamond devoted to the service of a god, but  to a semi-transparent stone of the inferior order of gems, supposed to  be affected by the lunar influences--the moon, in this latter case also,  giving the name by which the stone is still known to collectors in our  own time.    The adventures of the Yellow Diamond begin with the eleventh century of  the Christian era.    At that date, the Mohammedan conqueror, Mahmoud of Ghizni, crossed  India; seized on the holy city of Somnauth; and stripped of its  treasures the famous temple, which had stood for centuries--the shrine  of Hindoo pilgrimage, and the wonder of the Eastern world.    Of all the deities worshipped in the temple, the moon-god alone escaped  the rapacity of the conquering Mohammedans. Preserved by three Brahmins,  the inviolate deity, bearing the Yellow Diamond in its forehead, was  removed by night, and was transported to the second of the sacred cities  of India--the city of Benares. 
CollWTM.txt	34	141120.0	1868	Collins, Wilkie	The Moonstone	  Not a soul was told the girl's story, excepting Miss Rachel and me. My  lady, doing me the honour to consult me about most things, consulted  me about Rosanna. Having fallen a good deal latterly into the late Sir  John's way of always agreeing with my lady, I agreed with her heartily  about Rosanna Spearman.    A fairer chance no girl could have had than was given to this poor girl  of ours. None of the servants could cast her past life in her teeth, for  none of the servants knew what it had been. She had her wages and her  privileges, like the rest of them; and every now and then a friendly  word from my lady, in private, to encourage her. In return, she showed  herself, I am bound to say, well worthy of the kind treatment bestowed  upon her. Though far from strong, and troubled occasionally with those  fainting-fits already mentioned, she went about her work modestly and  uncomplainingly, doing it carefully, and doing it well. But, somehow,  she failed to make friends among the other women servants, excepting my  daughter Penelope, who was always kind to Rosanna, though never intimate  with her. 
CollWTM.txt	51	525600.0	1868	Collins, Wilkie	The Moonstone	The men wouldn't let him into their clubs; the women--more than  one--whom he wanted to marry, refused him; friends and relations got too  near-sighted to see him in the street.    Some men in this mess would have tried to set themselves right with  the world. But to give in, even when he was wrong, and had all society  against him, was not the way of the Honourable John. He had kept the  Diamond, in flat defiance of assassination, in India. He kept the  Diamond, in flat defiance of public opinion, in England. There you have  the portrait of the man before you, as in a picture: a character that  braved everything; and a face, handsome as it was, that looked possessed  by the devil.    We heard different rumours about him from time to time. Sometimes  they said he was given up to smoking opium and collecting old books;  sometimes he was reported to be trying strange things in chemistry;  sometimes he was seen carousing and amusing himself among the lowest  people in the lowest slums of London. Anyhow, a solitary, vicious,  underground life was the life the Colonel led. Once, and once only,  after his return to England, I myself saw him, face to face.

"But if he HAS  purposely left a legacy of trouble and danger to his sister, by the  means of her child, it must be a legacy made conditional on his sister's  being alive to feel the vexation of it."    "Oh! That's your interpretation of his motive, is it? The Subjective  interpretation again! Have you ever been in Germany, Betteredge?"    "No, sir. What's your interpretation, if you please?"    "I can see," says Mr. Franklin, "that the Colonel's object may, quite  possibly, have been--not to benefit his niece, whom he had never even  seen--but to prove to his sister that he had died forgiving her, and to  prove it very prettily by means of a present made to her child. There is  a totally different explanation from yours, Betteredge, taking its  rise in a Subjective-Objective point of view. From all I can see, one  interpretation is just as likely to be right as the other."    Having brought matters to this pleasant and comforting issue, Mr.  Franklin appeared to think that he had completed all that was required  of him. He laid down flat on his back on the sand, and asked what was to  be done next. 
CollWTM.txt	92	40320.0	1868	Collins, Wilkie	The Moonstone	  With all his brightness and cleverness and general good qualities, Mr.  Franklin's chance of topping Mr. Godfrey in our young lady's estimation  was, in my opinion, a very poor chance indeed.    In the first place, Mr. Godfrey was, in point of size, the finest man by  far of the two. He stood over six feet high; he had a beautiful red and  white colour; a smooth round face, shaved as bare as your hand; and a  head of lovely long flaxen hair, falling negligently over the poll of  his neck. But why do I try to give you this personal description of  him? If you ever subscribed to a Ladies' Charity in London, you know Mr.  Godfrey Ablewhite as well as I do. He was a barrister by profession;  a ladies' man by temperament; and a good Samaritan by choice. Female  benevolence and female destitution could do nothing without him.  Maternal societies for confining poor women; Magdalen societies for  rescuing poor women; strong-minded societies for putting poor women into  poor men's places, and leaving the men to shift for themselves;--he was  vice-president, manager, referee to them all. Wherever there was a table  with a committee of ladies sitting round it in council there was Mr. 
CollWTM.txt	111	180.0	1868	Collins, Wilkie	The Moonstone	  What HE said about the Diamond to Miss Rachel was said, as usual, by way  of a mystification or joke. He gravely entreated her (in the interests  of science) to let him take it home and burn it. "We will first heat it,  Miss Rachel," says the doctor, "to such and such a degree; then we  will expose it to a current of air; and, little by little--puff!--we  evaporate the Diamond, and spare you a world of anxiety about the safe  keeping of a valuable precious stone!" My lady, listening with rather a  careworn expression on her face, seemed to wish that the doctor had been  in earnest, and that he could have found Miss Rachel zealous enough in  the cause of science to sacrifice her birthday gift.    The other guest, who sat on my young lady's right hand, was an eminent  public character--being no other than the celebrated Indian traveller,  Mr. Murthwaite, who, at risk of his life, had penetrated in disguise  where no European had ever set foot before.    This was a long, lean, wiry, brown, silent man. He had a weary look, and  a very steady, attentive eye. It was rumoured that he was tired of the  humdrum life among the people in our parts, and longing to go back and  wander off on the tramp again in the wild places of the East. Except  what he said to Miss Rachel about her jewel, I doubt if he spoke six  words or drank so much as a single glass of wine, all through the  dinner.
CollWTM.txt	180	10.0	1868	Collins, Wilkie	The Moonstone	  Leaving the room with this message, I heard Mr. Franklin ask the  Sergeant a question, and stopped to hear the answer also at the  threshold of the door.    "Can you guess yet," inquired Mr. Franklin, "who has stolen the  Diamond?"    "NOBODY HAS STOLEN THE DIAMOND," answered Sergeant Cuff.    We both started at that extraordinary view of the case, and both  earnestly begged him to tell us what he meant.    "Wait a little," said the Sergeant. "The pieces of the puzzle are not  all put together yet."        CHAPTER XIII      I found my lady in her own sitting room. She started and looked annoyed  when I mentioned that Sergeant Cuff wished to speak to her.    "MUST I see him?" she asked. "Can't you represent me, Gabriel?"    I felt at a loss to understand this, and showed it plainly, I suppose,  in my face. My lady was so good as to explain herself.    "I am afraid my nerves are a little shaken," she said. "There is  something in that police-officer from London which I recoil from--I  don't know why. I have a presentiment that he is bringing trouble and  misery with him into the house. Very foolish, and very unlike ME--but so  it is."    I hardly knew what to say to this. The more I saw of Sergeant Cuff, the  better I liked him. My lady rallied a little after having opened her  heart to me--being, naturally, a woman of a high courage, as I have  already told you.

In the case of my misguided aunt, the form which pious perseverance was  next to take revealed itself to me plainly enough.    Preparation by clerical friends had failed, owing to Lady Verinder's  own reluctance. Preparation by books had failed, owing to the doctor's  infidel obstinacy. So be it! What was the next thing to try? The next  thing to try was--Preparation by Little Notes. In other words, the books  themselves having been sent back, select extracts from the books, copied  by different hands, and all addressed as letters to my aunt, were, some  to be sent by post, and some to be distributed about the house on the  plan I had adopted on the previous day. As letters they would excite no  suspicion; as letters they would be opened--and, once opened, might be  read. Some of them I wrote myself. "Dear aunt, may I ask your attention  to a few lines?" &c. "Dear aunt, I was reading last night, and I chanced  on the following passage," &c. Other letters were written for me by my  valued fellow-workers, the sisterhood at the Mothers'-Small-Clothes. 
CollWTM.txt	430	10.0	1868	Collins, Wilkie	The Moonstone	Overwhelmed by the exquisite triumph of having got him back among  us, I let him do what he liked with my hands. I closed my eyes. I felt  my head, in an ecstasy of spiritual self-forgetfulness, sinking on his  shoulder. In a moment more I should certainly have swooned away in his  arms, but for an interruption from the outer world, which brought me to  myself again. A horrid rattling of knives and forks sounded outside the  door, and the footman came in to lay the table for luncheon.    Mr. Godfrey started up, and looked at the clock on the mantelpiece.    "How time flies with YOU!" he exclaimed. "I shall barely catch the  train."    I ventured on asking why he was in such a hurry to get back to town.  His answer reminded me of family difficulties that were still to be  reconciled, and of family disagreements that were yet to come.    "I have heard from my father," he said. "Business obliges him to leave  Frizinghall for London to-day, and he proposes coming on here, either  this evening or to-morrow. I must tell him what has happened between  Rachel and me. His heart is set on our marriage--there will be great  difficulty, I fear, in reconciling him to the breaking-off of the  engagement. I must stop him, for all our sakes, from coming here till he  IS reconciled. Best and dearest of friends, we shall meet again!" 
CollWTM.txt	493	12960.0	1868	Collins, Wilkie	The Moonstone	  This change made it necessary for me to send one of my servants to  obtain my letters and remittances from the English consul in a certain  city, which was no longer included as one of my resting-places in my new  travelling scheme. The man was to join me again at an appointed place  and time. An accident, for which he was not responsible, delayed him on  his errand. For a week I and my people waited, encamped on the  borders of a desert. At the end of that time the missing man made his  appearance, with the money and the letters, at the entrance of my tent.    "I am afraid I bring you bad news, sir," he said, and pointed to one of  the letters, which had a mourning border round it, and the address on  which was in the handwriting of Mr. Bruff.    I know nothing, in a case of this kind, so unendurable as suspense. The  letter with the mourning border was the letter that I opened first.    It informed me that my father was dead, and that I was heir to his great  fortune. The wealth which had thus fallen into my hands brought its  responsibilities with it, and Mr. Bruff entreated me to lose no time in  returning to England.    By daybreak the next morning, I was on my way back to my own country. 
CollWTM.txt	508	3.0	1868	Collins, Wilkie	The Moonstone	  "My mind is made up, my old friend. Even Sergeant Cuff doesn't daunt me.  By-the-bye, I may want to speak to him, sooner or later. Have you heard  anything of him lately?"    "The Sergeant won't help you, Mr. Franklin."    "Why not?"    "There has been an event, sir, in the police-circles, since you went  away. The great Cuff has retired from business. He has got a little  cottage at Dorking; and he's up to his eyes in the growing of roses.  I have it in his own handwriting, Mr. Franklin. He has grown the white  moss rose, without budding it on the dog-rose first. And Mr. Begbie the  gardener is to go to Dorking, and own that the Sergeant has beaten him  at last."    "It doesn't much matter," I said. "I must do without Sergeant Cuff's  help. And I must trust to you, at starting."    It is likely enough that I spoke rather carelessly.    At any rate, Betteredge seemed to be piqued by something in the reply  which I had just made to him. "You might trust to worse than me, Mr.  Franklin--I can tell you that," he said a little sharply.    The tone in which he retorted, and a certain disturbance, after he had  spoken, which I detected in his manner, suggested to me that he was  possessed of some information which he hesitated to communicate. 
CollWTM.txt	542	60.0	1868	Collins, Wilkie	The Moonstone	  "But the bare thought that YOU had let yourself down to my level, and  that I, in possessing myself of your nightgown, had also possessed  myself of the means of shielding you from being discovered, and  disgraced for life--I say, sir, the bare thought of this seemed to  open such a chance before me of winning your good will, that I passed  blindfold, as one may say, from suspecting to believing. I made up my  mind, on the spot, that you had shown yourself the busiest of anybody  in fetching the police, as a blind to deceive us all; and that the hand  which had taken Miss Rachel's jewel could by no possibility be any other  hand than yours.    "The excitement of this new discovery of mine must, I think, have turned  my head for a while. I felt such a devouring eagerness to see you--to  try you with a word or two about the Diamond, and to MAKE you look at  me, and speak to me, in that way--that I put my hair tidy, and made  myself as nice as I could, and went to you boldly in the library where I  knew you were writing. 
CollWTM.txt	734	15.0	1868	Collins, Wilkie	The Moonstone	  The money-lender came out from the inner regions of the bank, followed  by his two guardian policemen in plain clothes.    "Keep your eye on him," whispered Mr. Bruff. "If he passes the Diamond  to anybody, he will pass it here."    Without noticing either of us, Mr. Luker slowly made his way to the  door--now in the thickest, now in the thinnest part of the crowd.  I distinctly saw his hand move, as he passed a short, stout man,  respectably dressed in a suit of sober grey. The man started a little,  and looked after him. Mr. Luker moved on slowly through the crowd. At  the door his guard placed themselves on either side of him. They were  all three followed by one of Mr. Bruff's men--and I saw them no more.    I looked round at the lawyer, and then looked significantly towards the  man in the suit of sober grey. "Yes!" whispered Mr. Bruff, "I saw it  too!" He turned about, in search of his second man. The second man  was nowhere to be seen. He looked behind him for his attendant sprite.  Gooseberry had disappeared.    "What the devil does it mean?" said Mr. Bruff angrily. "They have both  left us at the very time when we want them most."    It came to the turn of the man in the grey suit to transact his business  at the counter. He paid in a cheque--received a receipt for it--and  turned to go out. 
CollWTM.txt	791	90.0	1868	Collins, Wilkie	The Moonstone	  One of the spectators, near whom I was standing, saw me start. In a  whisper, he explained to me the apparition of the three figures on the  platform of rock.    They were Brahmins (he said) who had forfeited their caste in the  service of the god. The god had commanded that their purification should  be the purification by pilgrimage. On that night, the three men were to  part. In three separate directions, they were to set forth as pilgrims  to the shrines of India. Never more were they to look on each other's  faces. Never more were they to rest on their wanderings, from the day  which witnessed their separation, to the day which witnessed their  death.    As those words were whispered to me, the plaintive music ceased. The  three men prostrated themselves on the rock, before the curtain which  hid the shrine. They rose--they looked on one another--they embraced.  Then they descended separately among the people. The people made way  for them in dead silence. In three different directions I saw the crowd  part, at one and the same moment. Slowly the grand white mass of the  people closed together again. The track of the doomed men through the  ranks of their fellow mortals was obliterated. We saw them no more.    A new strain of music, loud and jubilant, rose from the hidden shrine.  The crowd around me shuddered, and pressed together.    The curtain between the trees was drawn aside, and the shrine was  disclosed to view.

And there, in the forehead of the deity, gleamed the yellow  Diamond, whose splendour had last shone on me in England, from the bosom  of a woman's dress!    Yes! after the lapse of eight centuries, the Moonstone looks forth once  more, over the walls of the sacred city in which its story first began.  How it has found its way back to its wild native land--by what accident,  or by what crime, the Indians regained possession of their sacred gem,  may be in your knowledge, but is not in mine. You have lost sight of it  in England, and (if I know anything of this people) you have lost sight  of it for ever.    So the years pass, and repeat each other; so the same events revolve in  the cycles of time. What will be the next adventures of the Moonstone?  Who can tell?

Two from a HUSBAND to a GENTLEMAN: AND Two from a HUSBAND to a WIFE.    LETTER I.    A Letter from the Husband to the Wife (once thought virtuous) left for her in her Servant's Hands the Day before the Husband went Abroad, which was on Sunday April the 16th, 1738, she having confessed her Love for another.    My Dearest Susanna Maria,  NOT Strength of Constitution, Spirits, Resolution, Reason, or all I can call to my Assistance, will, I find, prevent my having a violent Fit of Illness which increases daily: If God pleases to dismiss me this Life, it will be an Act of Mercy. My Heart trembles, my Senses stagger, what a State of Despair! I own the Hand of Providence, and submit to its eternal Justice; my Condition is greatly terrible: My own Faults glare upon me, and Self convicted I own; I ought to suffer much, yet, sure, mine is the heaviest Calamity that ever oppress'd human Nature: How vain, were an Attempt, to express it in Words: 'Tis not to be conceiv'd; 'tis only to be felt, and felt by me alone.  Where is the Religion, where the unspotted Truth, the whiten'd Innocence, that once shone out, so brightly, in a certain Mind? All lost! I hope not irrecoverably lost, in violent Passions and wild Notions, that impose upon the Understanding, and mislead the Mind benighted, 'till the Day may break and waken us, from cheating Dreams, to Certainty of Pain.

I have broke off to address the Almighty with a truly penitent, contrite Heart, with bitter Tears, unfeign'd Sorrow: Do you join in the Prayer; humbly implore that great divine Instructor, to illuminate your Mind, to waken a Sense of Truth, and convince, that without such Assistance, our own Reason is too weak to let us know when we err. The Indulgence of strong Passions will never permit us to judge candidly. How necessary is it to beg Grace of the divine Power; to do it fervently and unfeignedly, 'tis the only true Check on our wrong Thoughts, that otherwise lead us to wrong Actions; one brings on another, 'tis impossible to avoid it, if not timely stopp'd. How dismal are my Nights? How miserable my Days? Oh, Child, be cautious, lest, too late, you own with me, 'tis a bitter aggravating Circumstance of Sorrow, to be conscious, our Follies may, in some Measure have deserv'd it. May the just, the all-gracious God, hear, and be my Witness, since I was married, that I never thought of any one, with the Ideas of Love, but my own dear Wife; whom now I    love with all the Esteem, Tenderness, cordial Affection, and fond Concern, that ever possess'd the Breast of Man, as a Husband or Lover: No Parent, not even a Mother, can more fondly dote on her only new-born Child. That I have been heretofore negligent of my Person, my Fortune, and Character, with Shame and Sorrow, I own; and God only knows how terrible my Punishment!

'tis fearing your Conscience, midst all the Calamities and Disappointments you ever met: Examine your Mind and tell me; Did there not appear great Solace from the Consciousness of a well disposed and warrantable Inclination, and gave not Religion a Comfort, which nought else can so effectually do? I have been too well acquainted with the Volence of some Passions, and know how much they blind our Reason: But Truth will prevail at last, and when we find that has not been our Guide, how shocking our Condition! Your truest Friend tells you this, who knows it, by sad Experience; profit by the Example: The Struggle will over pay itself. Ah! my Life, I wish not to cure the Wounds of your dear Mind with Corrosives; I would pour the Balm of Comfort, tho' I am mentioning what is a Dagger in my Heart; but thy kind Hand can remove it, and I will draw a Veil over it, that the Operation may not too strongly affect you: Think this, Justice, Honour, Duty, all the Ties of Religion, Virtue, Truth, and Humanity, plead my unhappy    Cause; your not complying, ends in the Ruin of all; it must end in mine, and, which, to me, appears still worse, I fear your own Destruction.

I am lost in Astonishment when I recollect, I have seen that innocent Face of her's, as it once appear'd to me, received (ay, both of us received on a friendly Footing) in a sober Family of Distinction and Reputation, where there appear'd a general Harmony of Love and Friendship; She handsomely treated, by Gentlemen of Figure and Fortune, invited and caress'd by Ladies of deserved Reputation: Placed by the Side of one, whom I shudder to think of, and will not be so indelicate to dwell on 'em in my Thought, least my Imagination should start strange Fancies.

If by any Accident it has not been immediately in my Power to discharge 'em; let me say, 'twas a cruel artful Manner of deluding me, with what I ought (all Things consider'd) to call, the Appearance of Obligations only: 'Tis plain they were meant to disarm me of that Resentment you were conscious, I must, some Time or other, waken to.

Let me tell you, Sir, those in whom I thought I could place the highest Confidence, have disappointed and betray'd me; where I center'd my Hopes of Happiness, I have met with Shame, Ingratitude and Ruin. How very early Attempts were made against my Peace of Mind, and all that's valuable to Man, is best known to those who took strange Methods, cooly, and deliberately to plan my Destruction: Tho' I scorn (as I have told you more than once)    a base, low, malicious, treacherous Revenge; yet, I am compell'd to inform you, whatever Man ought to do, I dare do, Sir, let the Trial come when it will: Tho' perhaps, 'tis scarce Courage to say (after being stabb'd thro' the Heart) you are welcome to a fair Opportunity of shooting me thro' the Head, or running me thro' the Body; if your own Honour, your own Conscience, your own Understanding dictate to you, more should be said, or done, by one in my tortur'd, unhappy Condition, think it said already, and save me the Pain of repeating Words that bear a harsh Sound, to one whom Friendship, Respect and good Will, have not permitted me to look on hatefully; tho' I am, thro' your Means, the most undone of Mankind.

Tho' she had Impudence and Folly enough to think, I would continue, on any Consideration of Luxury, or Vanity, to play the ridiculous infamous Part of a feigned Husband; sure, no Man, in his Senses, thought I would or could: If you know such a one, Sir, tell 'em, I can teach myself to think as cheaply, as badly of them, as they must of me. Favours, of any Sort, I neither expect, or want, or would receive; I should detest those who could proffer 'em, as I should myself to accept 'em: And, without mincing the Matter, Sir, I must tell you, my Acquaintance, with you, has been the most expensive of any I ever had, perhaps; I mean so in a literal Sense, for I have ever been too apt to appear and act above myself, both at Home and Abroad: And never omitted, in every Respect, entertaining others in the Manner I thought they deserv'd.

The winds then cease to befriend the panting inhabitants  ; and while the thermometer stands at 90°, there is no  steady breeze as during the preceding months of summer.  Light puffs of wind now and then fan the brow of the negro,  and relieve for an instant the oppression of the European settler;  but they are gone as soon as come, and seem only to  have left the heat more intolerable than before.  Of these sultry evenings, one of the sultriest was the 22d  of August, 1791. This was one of five days appointed for  rejoicings in the town of Cap Frangais ; festivities among the  French and Creole inhabitants, who were as ready to rejoice  on appointed occasions as the dullness of colonial life renders  natural, but who would have been yet more lively than they  were if the date of their festival had been in January or May.  There was no choice as to the date, however. They were  governed in regard to their celebrations by what happened at  Paris ; and never had the proceedings of the mother-country  been so important to the colony as now.

The mulatto proprietors and merchants of the island  innocently understood the words according to their commonly «  i received meaning, and expected an equal share with the whites  s in the representation of the colony, in the distribution of its offices,  and in the civil rights of its inhabitants generally. These  rights having been denied by the whites to the freeborn  ' mulattoes, with every possible manifestation of contempt and  4 THE HOUR AND THE MAtf.  dislike, an effort had been made to wring from the whites by  force what they would not grant to reason, and an ill princi  pled and ill managed revolt had taken place in the preceding  October, headed by Vincent Oge and his brother, sons of the  proprietress of a coffee plantation a few miles from Cap Francais.  These young men were executed under circumstances  of great barbarity. Their sufferings were as seed sown in  the warm bosoms of their companions and adherents, to spring  up in due season in a harvest of vigorous revenge. The  whites suspected this, and were as anxious as their dusky  neighbours to obtain the friendship and sanction of the revolutionary  government at home. That government was fluctuating  in its principles and in its counsels ; it favoured now one  party, and now the other; and on the arrival of its messengers  at the porta of the colony, there ensued sometimes the  loud boastings of the whites, and sometimes quiet, knowing  smiles and whispered congratulations among the depressed  section of the inhabitants.

" Father, " said Placide, joining the group, " why is Jean  commanding your march ? He speaks to you as if you were  under him."  " Because he considers it his march."  " He praised your father very much, Placide, " said his  mother.  " Yes, just as if my father was under him; as if the march  were not ours. We began it."

Look at his cocked hat."  " And he calls himself commander-in-chief of the armies of  France."  " In St. Domingo. Well, so he is, " said Toussaint, smiling,  and pointing to the troop. " Here are the armies of the King  of France in St. Domingo, and here Jean commands."  At this moment Jean made proclamation for Toussaint  Breda; and Toussaint joined him, leaving his wife saying,  " You see he wants my husband at every turn. I am sure he  thinks a great deal of my husband."

The prisoners were removed by one door, while the imposing  party from France entered by the other.  Commissary Hedouville, who had been for seme time resident  at Cap Francois, errteTed, followed by a party of his  countrymen just arrived from Paris. There was among them  one, at sight of whom Toussaint's countenance changed, while  an exclamation was heard from the piazza, which showed that  his family were moved like himself. The person who excited  this emotion was a young black officer, who entered smiling,  and as if scarcely able to keep his place behind the commissary  and General Michel, the head of the new deputation.

The  flamingoes took flight again from the strand ; the ships moved  in their anchorage; the shouts of the people arose from the  town, and those of the soldiery from the square of the great  avenue.

The  walk, once a smooth shaven turf, kept green by trenches of  water, was now.overgrown with the vegetation which encroached  on either hand. As the dark beauty forced her way, the  maypole aloe shook its yellow crown of flowers many feet  above her head ; the lilach jessamine danced before her face ;  and the white datura, the pink flower fence, and the scarlet  cordia, closed round her form, or spread themselves beneath  her feet. Her lover was soon again by her side, warding off  every branch and spray, and saying,  "The very flowers worship you : but they and all — all must  yield you to me. You are mine ; and yet not mine till I have  won you from your father. Genifrede, how shall I distinguish  myself? Show me the way, and I shall succeed."  " Do not ask me, " she replied, sighing.  " Nay, whom should I ask ?"  " I never desired you to distinguish yourself."  " You do not wish it ?"  " No."  " Not for your sake ?"  "No."  And she looked around her with wistful eyes, in which her  lover read a wish that things would ever remain as they were  now — that this moment would never pass away.  " You would remain here — you would hide yourself here  with me for ever!" cried the happy Moyse.

The ridge passed, down plunged the horseman, hurrying  to the valley and the plain — like rocks loosened by the  thunder from the mountain top.

Ri  giiurl had surrendered his designs, and had actually sailed, with  his principal officers, for France. Thus was the last torch of  war extinguished in the colony, and matters of peaceful policy  alone lay before the Council of Five.  The announcement of the entire pacification of the island  was the first made by L'Ouverture, when his friends and councillors  looked eagerly to him for what he should say.  " Vincent is a fine fellow, " said Dessalines, " and a credit to  his colour."  " He has been in the most pressing danger, " observed Toussaint.  " God willed that he should escape, when escape appeared  impossible."  " What is to be done now with these cowardly devils of mulattoes  ?" asked Dessalines.  M. Pascal glanced at Raymond to see how he bore this.  Raymond chanced to meet his eye, and replied to the glance,  " You will not take me for a cowardly mulatto, M. Pascal, if  I do not resent Dessalines' words. He is speaking of the rebels,  not of the many mulattoes who, like myself, disapprove and  . despise all such jealousy of race as leads to the barbarism of  aggressive war."  " Yet, " said Christophe, " I wish that we should all avoid  such language as provokes jealousy of race."  " In council one must speak plainly, " replied Dessalines.

At first he looked  fierce, and the insurgents began to think each of getting away  as he best might. But in a few moments, no one seemed to  know how or why, the aspect of affairs changed. There was  an air of irresolution about the commander. It was plain that  he was not really disposed to be severe — that he had no deadly  intentions towards those he came to meet. His black troops  caught his mood. Some of the inhabitants of the town, who  were on the watch with glasses from the gates, from the  churches, and from the roofs of houses, afterward testified to  there having been a shaking of hands and other amicable gestures.  They testified that the insurgents crowded round General  Moyse, and gave at one time cheers, at another time  groans, evidently on a signal from him. No prisoners were  made — there was not a shot fired. The general and his soldiers  returned into the town, and even into their quarters, pro  217  testing that no farther mischief would happen ; but the insurgents  remained on the heights till daylight; and the inhabitants,  feeling themselves wholly unprotected, sent off expresses  to the commander-in-chief, and watched, with arms loaded, till  he, or one of his more trustworthy generals, should arrive.

She loved her so as to open to her all but the inner chambers  of her heart; and she trusted her with all but other persons  concerns.

Pascal, whose opinion was of  great value. Euphrosyne had a strong persuasion, all the while,  that she should one day tell her reverend mother the whole.  She knew that she should not object to her seeing every line  that Afra held of hers. Whatever was clandestine in the cor  respondence was for the sake of avoiding restraint, and not be  cause she was ashamed of any of her thoughts.

Flanking the village, and looking down  upon it from its own eminence, rose the  stately walls of Court Netherleigh : an imposing  and beautiful edifice, with which none  of those other mansions in the distance could  compare. It was built of quaint red brick,  curious but bright looking, and its gables and  angles were picturesque in a high degree.  Winding upwards from the village, you came  upon the entrance gates on the left of the  road — great gates of wrought iron, with two  smaller gates beside them. The lodges, built  to match the house, stood a little back, one  on each side the gates, roses and honeysuckles  adorning the porches and lower windows. In  one of these lodges, that on the left as you  entered, lived the gatekeeper and his family ;  in the other the head gardener. Let us, in  imagination, enter the gates.

At the back, hidden by  clusterino trees, are the stables and out offices.  Extensive gardens lie around, which show  a profusion of luscious fruits and choice  vegetables, of smooth, green lawns, miniature  rocks, grassy glades, and lovely flowers. Fine  old trees give shade to the park, deer sport on  its level grass. Altogether, the place is grand  and beautiful, and evidently well cared for.

It  was but a glimpse, for the window was high  from the ground, its embrasures deep, and  the cab close to the pavement ; and, for a  moment, he could not decide whether it belonged  to friend or foe ; but soon he drew  away with an ugly word, crossed the room to  unlatch the door, and stood with his ear at  the opening. What ! a peer condescend to  play eavesdropper, in an attitude that befits a  mean man ? Yes : and a prince has done the  same, when in bodily fear of duns. 
WoodECN.txt	189	2.0	1881	Wood, Ellen	Court Netherleigh	  This was quite the climax, and Selina  hastily interrupted. Lady Adela was even  more lovely than she herself was : very much,  too, in the same style of delicate beauty.  What would Adela be in that lace dress !    'I will take it, " cried Selina. '^ I must  have a slip of that peach glace to wear underneath  it."    " It will be altogether fit for a queen, "  quoth madame.    " But could I have them home by tomorrow  night for Lady Burnham's party ? "    Certainly madam can."    "Very well then, " concluded Selina. *' Or    — stay : would white look better under it,    after all ? I have ever so many white glace  slips."    Madame 's opinion was that no colour, ever    seen in the earth or in the air, could, or would    look as well as the peach. Milady Grey could    not wear peach ; she was too dark.    WITH MADAME DAMEREAU. 243    '' Yes, I'Ll decide upon the peach blossom/'    concluded Selina. '^ But that's not a good  silk, is it ? "    Si. Mais si, C'Est de la sole cuite."    ** And that is all, I think, for today'    *' will Madame Dalreemp wear in her  hair with this tomorrow night ?"    'Ah! that's well thought of. It must  be either white or peach."    ^' Or mixed. Cherchez la boite, numero  deux, " quietly added madame to an attendant. 
WoodECN.txt	212	60.0	1881	Wood, Ellen	Court Netherleigh	  My husband thought I could have worn  one of my old dresses, " observed Selina, as  she turned over some gloves; 'My says I  have a great many. But one can only appear  in a perfectly fresh toilette at a magnificent  gathering such as this is to be." And madame  fully assented.    Mrs. Dalrymple went to the breakfast, and  she and her attire were lovely amidst the  lovely, exciting no end of admiration. Very  gratifying to her heart, then topsy turvey  with vanity. And so it went on to the end  of the season, and her pleasurable course was  never checked.    When they were preparing to return to the  Grange, and her maid was driven wild with  perplexity as to the stowing away of so extensive  a wardrobe, and conjecturing that the    272 COURT NETHERLEIGH.    carriage down of it would alone come to  '* something, " it occurred to Selina, as she  sat watching, that the original cost would  also come to ^' something." Some hundreds,  she feared, now she came to see the whole  collection in a mass.    ^* Of course I shall not let Oscar see the  bill, " she soliloquised. *' I'Ll get it from  madame before I leave : and then there'll be  no fear of its coming to him at the Grange."    Mrs. Dalrymple asked for the bill ; and  madame, under protest that there was no  hurry in the world, promised to send it in. 
WoodECN.txt	246	5.0	1881	Wood, Ellen	Court Netherleigh	  ''Ay!"    ** And, for the present, I say, keep up a  good heart — and hear. It is my best advice  to you."    He took her hand within both his, and  pressed it fervently, making no comment in  words. And just then the fly pulled up in the  Strand.    ''I have not asked about your mother, "  said Miss Upton, as he stood at the door to  say farewell after getting out.    '' She is pretty well, thank you, now."    " And your sister ? Does she get over  that WTetched business of Eobert Dalrymple's?"      '* Of course — in a degree. Time softens  most things. But she will never forget  him."    He shook hands finally with Miss Upton ;  he walked on to his house in Leadenhall  Street, his step flagging, his heart weary.  Entering his own private room, he found two    3i6 COURT NETHERLEIGH.    ladies within it. His mother, who was seated  in the most easy chair the room afforded ;  and his sister. Mrs. Lynn was a tall, dignified,  upright woman still : her beautiful grey  eyes were just like his own, her refined countenance,  sickly now, bore yet its marks of  unusual intellect.    *' Mother!" he exclaimed, in surprise. 
WoodECN.txt	300	2.0	1881	Wood, Ellen	Court Netherleigh	  " That was another ; that one is all safe, "  interrupted Alice. " The one missing is of  fine gold links interspersed with brilliants.  Did you see it ? "    64 COURT NETHERLEIGH.    *' Not that I remember. I was there  scarcely a minute, for I had only strolled into  the back room just before you came down.  To tell ou the truth, Alice, my mind was too  fully occupied with other things, to take much  notice even of jewels. Do not look so perplexed  : it will be all right. Only you and I  were in the room, you say; and we could not  take it."    '^ Oh ! " exclaimed Alice, clasping her  hands, and lifting her white, beseeching face  to her sister's, " did you take it ? In — in    sport ; or in Oh, surely you were not    tempted to take it for anything else ? Forgive  me, Selina ! you said you had need of  money.''    " Alice, are we going to have one of our  old scenes of excitement ? Strive for calmness.  I am sure you do not know what you  are implying. My poor child, I would rather  help you to jewels than take them from ou."    " But look at the mystery." 
WoodECN.txt	302	10.0	1881	Wood, Ellen	Court Netherleigh	emphatically concluded Selina.    Not only was the denial fervent and calm,  but Selina' s manner and countenance conveyed  the impression of truth. Alice left  her, inexpressibly relieved ; though the conviction,  that it must have been Gerard, returned  to her in full force. "' I wish I could  see him! " was her mental exclamation.    And for once fortune favoured her wish.  As she was dragging her weary limbs along, he  came right upon her at the corner of a street.    I am so thankful, " she exclaimed. ''I  wanted to see you."    I think you most want to see a doctor,  Alice. How ill you look ! "    *' I have cause, " she returned. "That  bracelet has been stolen."    " Which bracelet ? " asked Gerard.    " That valuable one. The diamond. It  was taken from the room."    THE DIAMOND BRACELET. 67    ** Taken when ? " he rejoined, looking her  full in the face — as a guilty man would  scarcely dare to look."    *' Then; or within a few minutes of that time.  When Lady Sarah came up from dinner it was  not there. She came up almost immediately."    *^ Who took it ? " he repeated, not yet recovering  his surprise.    'I don't know, " she faintly said. ''It was  under my charge. No one else was there."    ''You do not wish me to understand that  you are suspected, " he burst forth with genuine  feeling. "• Their unjust meanness cannot  have gone that length." 
WoodECN.txt	509	4.0	1881	Wood, Ellen	Court Netherleigh	  *' I hope you will take care of her, " cried  Mr. Grubb as he rose, and pressed Lord  Acorn's hand in parting.    '^ To the best of my powxr. Ah, Grubb !  I — I can't grumble, of course ; no, neither at  the step nor the proposed arrangements —  but, if you coxdd but see your way to condone  the past ; to receive her back !"    ** Never again, " was the quiet answer.    lo COURT NETHERLEIGH.    *'Davvy can attend to the removal of lier  things from Grosvenor Square."    Mr. Grubb walked back to his own home  with slow and thoughtful steps, his heart  filled with the bitterness of disappointed  hopes. It is no light matter for a man to  part for ever with the wife of his bosom ; to  say to her, 'Your road lies that way from  henceforth; mine this." Especially a wife  who had been loved as Francis Grubb had  loved his.    That Adela had run away from his home,  abandoned it and him, he entertained not the  slightest doubt. She had been tacitJy demonstrating  to him for years that she wished to  be rid of him — indeed, not always tacitly —  and now she had accomplished it. This impression  did not lead to Mr. Grubb 's decision  to put her away ; it had, and could have had,  nothing to do with that ; but it tended to  deaden any small regret he may have felt. 
WoodECN.txt	538	2.0	1881	Wood, Ellen	Court Netherleigh	I have no very close friends. The Rector of  Netherleigh is the closest, and he has known  of it for some time. That is, he knows I am  suffering from a disorder that I shall probably  never get the better of. Your mother knows  it, for I told her this evening ; and now you  know it. My faithful maid Annis knows a  little — Frost and Dr. Stair know most of all.  Nobody else knows of it in the w4de world :  and I do not wish that anyone should know."    as it right ? Right to them ? "    *' Why, what other friends have I ? Lady  Acorn, you may say. She has never been as  a friend to me. Your mother and I, had  opportunity permitted, might have been the  truest and dearest friends, but I and Betsy    46 COURT NETHERLEIGH.    Acorn, never. She and I do not assimilate.  Time enough to proclaim my condition to the  world when I become so ill that it cannot be  concealed."    '* I wish I could die in your place ! '' he  too thoughtlessly exclaimed. Though, indeed,  trouble of all kinds seemed to be pressing so  sharply upon him that he almost did wish it.    ^* Don'T talk silly nonsense, " reproved Miss  Upton. " You have your work to do in the  world, your duties to fulfil. Eely upon it,  God does not call us away so long as any  remain to be done." 
WoodECN.txt	579	30240.0	1881	Wood, Ellen	Court Netherleigh	  Enough of the fever lingered yet to tinge  wdtli hectic her whiteface, and to heat her  trembling hands. But for one thought Adela  would not have cared wdiether she died or  lived — at least, she told herself so in her  misery ; and that thought was that, if she  died, her husband might take another wife.  A wife who would give him back what she  herself had not given — love for love. Since  Miss Upton, perhaps unwittingly, had  breathed that suggestion, it had not left  Adela night or day.    How bitterly she regretted the past none  knew, or ever would know. During these  weeks of illness, before the fever and since,  she had had leisure to dwell upon her conduct  ; to repent of it ; to pray to Heaven for    VOL. III. H    98 COURT NETHERLEIGH.    pardon for it. The approach of possible  death, the presence of hopeless misery had  brought Adela to that Eefuge which she had  never sought or found before, an ever merci  full God. Never again, even were it possible  that she should once more mingle with the  world, could she be the frivolous, heartless,  unchristian woman she had been. Nothing  in a small way had ever surprised Lady  Harriet so much, as to find Adela get out  her Bible and prayer book and keep them  near her. 
WoodECN.txt	594	3.0	1881	Wood, Ellen	Court Netherleigh	  What illness she has, rests on the  nerves, " proceeded the doctor. *' A little  on the mind. The earliest da I saw her I  asked whether she did have one great shock,  or trouble : you remember, do you not,  madame?"    ** But — good gracious! — one ought not to    ADELA STARTLED. 117    give way perpetually to any shock, or trouble —  even if one has had such a thing, " remonstrated  Lady Harriet.    *' As I say. Can anything be more clear ?  Miladi has nothing to render her sick, and yet    miladi sits there, all sick, day after day.    You hear, miladi ? " — turning to Adela.    h, yes, I hear, " she gently answered,  lifting her wan but still lovely face for a  moment, and then letting it drop again.    ''And it is time to end this state of  things, " resumed the doctor to Lady Harriet.  *' It must be finished, madame."    *' It ought to be, " acquiesced Lady Harriet.  *' But if she does not end it herself, how are  we to do it ? "    You go out, madame, with monsieur,  your husband, into a little society : is it not  so ? " spoke the doctor, after a pause of consideration,  during which he stroked his face  with his gloved hand.    " Of course we do, M. Feron ; we are not  hermits, and Paris is gay just now, " quickly  answered Lady Harriet. "We go to the  Blunts' tonight." 
WoodECN.txt	643	2.0	1881	Wood, Ellen	Court Netherleigh	  '' One does not often see such a bracelet as  this, '' pursued Frances. ''Where did you  buy it ? — if you don't mind my asking    '^ are my jewellers, " she replied.    This very nearly did for Frances : for it  was at Garrards' that the Colonel originally  purchased it : and it seemed to give a colouring  to Sir Francis Netherleigh's view of more  bracelets having been made of the same  pattern. But she was too anxious and determined  to stand upon ceremony — for Gerard's  sake : and he was dearer to her than the  world suspected.    ''We — one of my family — lost a bracelet  exactly like this some time back. When I  saw it on your arm, I thought it was the  same. I hoped it was."    The lady froze directly and laid down her  arm, making no reply.    ON LADY LIVINGSTONE's ARM, ii    " Are you — pardon me, there are painful  interests involved — are you sure you purchased  this at Garrards' ? "    " I have said that Messrs. Garrard are my  jewellers, " replied the stranger, in a cold,  repelling tone ; and the words sounded  evasive to Frances. "More I cannot say:  neither am I aware hy what law of courtesy  you thus question me, nor whom you may be."    The young lady drew herself up, proudly  secure in her name and rank. I am Lady    Frances Chenevix. And I must beg you    to pardon me." 
WoodECN.txt	699	2.0	1881	Wood, Ellen	Court Netherleigh	  " Do you mean that he died ? " returned  the stranger. But before Eeuben could answer,  Farmer Lee came up and commenced a warm  comment on the night's work.    " I hope there'll be no bloodshed, " said  he, *' we don't want that ; but the men are  growing more excited, and Mr. Dalrymple  has sent off a private messenger to the police  station."    " This gentleman used to know the family, "  interposed Eeuben ; "and has come to the    AXE ALARM. 253    place to night for the first tmie for years. This  riot is a fine welcome for him."    " I was asking some particulars of what  has transpired since my absence, " explained  the stranger. " I have been out of England,  and now thought to renew my acquaintance  with the family. What did Eobert Dalrymple  die of? I knew him well."    " He fell into trouble, sir, " answered  Keuben. " A random, wicked London set got  hold of him, fleeced and ruined him, and he  could not bear up against it."    " Died of it ? " questioned the stranger.    " He put an end to himself, " said Mr. Lee,  in a low tone. '' Threw himself into the  Thames from one of the London bridges, and  was drowned."    ' ' How deplorable ! And so the Grange  passed to Oscar Dalrymple ? " 
WoodECN.txt	757	3.0	1881	Wood, Ellen	Court Netherleigh	  ** Ay, a worthy man, my lady ; first-rate in  business. Talking of business, " broke off the  little alderman, glad no doubt to leave the  subject of the baby, but none the less inopportunely,  'do you chance to know what has  become of a young fellow who got into some  trouble at Grubb and Howard's — the Eector's  son, yonder " — nodding towards Mr. Cleveland  — *' Charles I think his name was. I have  often wished to ask about him."    Lady Adela bent over her child, as if to do  something to its cap : her face had flushed  bloodred'    '' Cleveland is in India, " she said.  ** He is doing well, very well. My husband  was — was very kind to him and pushes him  forward. He is kind to everyone."    Eising rather abruptly from the garden    328 COURT NETHERLEIGH.    bench, she gave the baby to the nurse and  went into the house. Her mother, standing  at one of the windows of the large drawing  room, turned round as she entered.    " What have you been doing to flush your  face so, Adela ? " called out my lady — for it  was glowing still.    "• Oh, nothing : the sun perhaps, '' answered  Adela, carelessly;    '* You were talking with Sir Turtle Kite."    ** Yes, he was looking at baby, and asking  me his name. I told him his father's —  Francis." 
WoodECN.txt	758	4.0	1881	Wood, Ellen	Court Netherleigh	  '* Ah, " said Lady Acorn, with her irrepressible  propensity for bringing up disagreeable  reminiscences, *' I remember the time  when you would not have your child's name  Francis, because it was your husband's."    *' Oh mamma, don't! That was in the  mistaken years of long ago."    ** And I hope you were civil to Sir Turtle, "  continued my lady: 'you seemed to leave  him very abruptly. He is a funny little  roundheaded man, and nothing but an  alderman, but he means well. Think what    CONCLUSION. 329    ijour fate might have been now — but for his  — his clemency."    '' If you would 'please not recall these things,  mother ! '' besought Adela, meekly, tears  starting to her eyes. " Especially today,  when we are all so happy."    Somehow the past, with all its terrible  mistakes and the misery they had entailed,  came rushing upon her mind so vividly that  she could not control her emotion. Passing  into the next room, and not perceiving her  husband, her sobs broke forth. He came forward.      '' My love, what is it ? "    Only "    ** tell me."    ** Something mamma said made me think  of that cruel time when — when I was so wrong  and wicked. Francis, the shame and sin  seemed all to come back again."    He held her before him ; his tone one of  tender reproof. *' But the shame and sin  never can come back, Adela. My wife, you  know it."    ** I know how good you are. And I know    z    330 COURT NETHERLEIGH,    how merciful to me God has been, " she replied,  glancing at him through her wet lashes,  with eyes full of love and devotion.    ** Very merciful : very merciful to me and  to you, " whispered Francis Netherleigh.

GordNBD.txt	0	1.0	1979	Gordimer, Nadine	Burger's daughter	One            Among the group of people waiting at the fortress was a schoolgirl in a brown and yellow uniform holding a green eiderdown quilt and, by the loop at its neck, a red hot-water bottle. Certain buses used to pass that way then and passengers looking out will have noticed a schoolgirl. Imagine, a schoolgirl: she must have somebody inside. Who are all those people, anyway ? Even from the top of a bus, lurching on past as the lights go green, the group would not have looked like the usual prison visitors, passive and self-effacing about the slope of municipal grass.    The schoolgirl stood neither in the first rank before the prison doors nor hung back. There were several young men in roll-neck sweaters and veldskoen, men in business suits worn absently as an outer skin, an old man with a thrust-back head of white floss, women burrowed down into slacks and duffle coats, one in a long skirt and crocheted shawl, two in elegant tweed suits, with gold jewellery and sunglasses worn not as a disguise but as an assertion of indifference to attention. All were drawn up before the doors, invaders rather than supplicants. All had parcels and carriers. The voices of the women were clear and forceful in the public place, the white-haired man put his arms on the shoulders of two young men in private discussion, a tall blonde woman moved within the group with chivvying determination.
GordNBD.txt	1	15.0	1979	Gordimer, Nadine	Burger's daughter	She it was who borrowed the old man’s horn-headed cane to knock on the door when three o’clock passed and they were still standing there. As there was no response she took off her high-heeled sandal and hammered away with that in the other hand, as well. No one was in a mood to laugh but there was a surge of movement and voices in approval. The schoolgirl pressed forward with the rest, turning her head with the bold encouragement with which glances were linking everyone. A small slotted door within the great double ones opened on eyes under a peaked cap. The blonde woman’s face was so close against the door that the warder drew back and in an instant reasserted himself, but as a fair-ground gun meets its pop-up target, she had him.    —I demand to speak to the Commandant...we were told we could bring clothing for the detainees between three and four. We’ve been standing here twenty-five minutes, most of us’ve got jobs to go back to.—    There was an argument. A man with a briefcase arrived and the group quickly tunnelled him to the fore; he was allowed in through another door within the great portal and then, one by one, the men and women handed over their burdens through this doorway blotted dark by the shapes of warders. The schoolgirl was urged on, given way to by others; Lionel Burger’s daughter was among them that day, fourteen years old, bringing an eiderdown quilt and a hot-water bottle for her mother. 
GordNBD.txt	97	45.0	1979	Gordimer, Nadine	Burger's daughter	  On the grass black men slept deeply, face down; they might have been dead. On benches avoided by other people, white tramps with drunkard’s blue eyes and the brief midday dapperness of hair slicked back in the municipal washroom, approached each other confidentially, came and went with the dogged, shambling dedication of their single purpose—to find money for a bottle. Sometimes one of these who were fixtures along with the pigeons was apart from the others, drunk, asleep, or in some inertia and immobility that was neither. Rosa, seeing one like this, chose a bench on the other side of the walk. But she need not have thought he might make a nuisance of himself; she ate her lunch, two little boys ran up and down twirling plastic whirligigs before him, a girl wearing the name DARLENE in gilt letters suspended on either side by a gilt chain round a freckled neck kissed a young man for the full time it took a pantechnicon, unable to turn at the traffic lights because of a parked car, to manoeuvre its length back into the street from which it had emerged; one of the children was caught and smacked on the back of the thighs by its mother; a fat man in a blue suit dropped an ice-cream cone which was pecked away by the birds; the clock that could be heard only within a radius of three blocks of the old post office struck the single wavering note of one o’clock and then the half-hour; and still the man did not move, sitting with his leg crossed over the other at the knee, arms folded, head sunk forward like that of someone who has dozed during a speech. A pigeon alighted on his shoulder and took off clumsily again. 
GordNBD.txt	165	3.0	1979	Gordimer, Nadine	Burger's daughter	  She was not sure she understood me. Or she understood instantly; I had an impatient sense that I was part of her mental process, I was there, taking fright at what exists only once it has been spoken. She tried an interpretation as a specific reference: without me, without the photocopies at Barry Eckhard’s building—oh, she would find some other possibility. Although (half-offended, half-appealing for sympathy) for the moment she was damned if she knew what.    I began to recite a quiet liturgy.—The people will no longer tolerate. The people’s birthright. The day has come when the people demand—    She stared at me as if I were shouting.    I spoke with interest, nothing more.—When you see reports of the evidence in newspapers, doesn’t it sound ridiculous ? Still the kits with invisible ink, the forged passports, the secret plans kept like dry cleaners’ slips, the mailing-lists, the same old story of people who are ‘approached’ and turn state witness after having licked some envelopes... You want to laugh, you can’t help it; it’s pathetic. You’ll print your news-sheet or you’ll send out your leaflets. It’s all decided already, from the beginning, before you’ve begun. A few pieces of paper, a few months, and you’ll be caught. You’ll be traced easily or someone you’ve trusted will get twenty rand and sell you. An enemy of the people... You’ll disappear into detention. Maybe there’ll be a case and a lawyer who tries for mitigation, shaming you by making all the old slogans mean less than they mean.—    Her face slowly thickened and concentrated before me the way the faces of patients at the hospital would register an injection releasing the sensation of some substance into the bloodstream. 
GordNBD.txt	178	10.0	1979	Gordimer, Nadine	Burger's daughter	  Some of the big stores have boutiques where they sell African crafts. This follows a demand, the wave of nostalgia for the ethnic in parts of the world where ethnics are put to no sinister purpose. It’s currently fashionable merchandise that’s on display, rather than anything understood as national culture; Buy South African refers to manufactured goods and not to the carved bowls and ostrich-shell necklaces hanging somewhere between small leather-goods and cosmetic counters. The store I tried didn’t have beaded belts but I thought the wristbands, athletically, orthopaedically masculine, with bright plastic thongs woven through holes in the tough leather, worn by migratory mineworkers who made them, could be worn effectively by a Scandinavian Africa specialist, and I bought one, god knows why. The huge perfumed street floor of the shop tented the pleasure of people spending money, that peculiar atmosphere of desire and anxious satisfaction evident in the faces, hardly high enough to chin showcases, of children gathered at troughs of cheap array, and women matching colours under the advice of bosom friends, and couples conspiring over price; the spectacle, of objects they can never own as well as those which bait from them the money they have, people yearn for in the countries of the Future my father visited with both his wives. Any one of the coloured artisans and their families or the white student lovers watching arrests a few blocks away was free to enter and see legitimate aspirations that carry no risk of punishment—fully automatic washing machines, electronic watches, cowboy boots, recordings of popular music by heroes who take their groups’ names from the vocabulary of revolution. The act of acquisition. You have to acquire a yacht to escape it. A woman beside me as I waited to pay opposed her little boy: But you don’t want that? What’ll you do with it? It’s not a toy! He held tightly a patent fluff-removing brush and would not meet anyone’s eyes. 
GordNBD.txt	193	4320.0	1979	Gordimer, Nadine	Burger's daughter	My father’s biographer, respectfully coaxing me onto the stepping-stones of the official vocabulary—words, nothing but dead words, abstractions: that’s not where reality is, you flung at me—national democratic revolution, ideological integration, revolutionary imperative, minority domination, liberation alliance, unity of the people, infiltration, incursion, viable agency for change, reformist option, armed tactics, mass political mobilization of the people in a combination of legal, semi-legal and clandestine methods—those footholds have come back to my vocabulary lately through parrying him. I don’t know where Baasie is but his father was found dead in a cell after eight months in detention. The police said he hanged himself with his trousers. I managed to convey the news to my father, in prison. Don’t ask me how. He didn’t know, I couldn’t tell him the passbook was one of those I had been able to hand over so easily no one would believe that is how it is done. I find it very hard to tell the difference between the truth and the facts: to know what the facts are? If Abraham at the garage had been a trap the circumstances of my failed mission would have read as ridiculously as any I exposed before poor Clare Terblanche. What was the reality of that weekend in the Western Transvaal dorp ? An act in the third category of methods (legal, semi-legal and clandestine) to co-ordinate political struggle and armed activity in creating an all-round climate of collapse in which a direct political solution becomes possible ? The material transcendence of a man’s span by the recording, for posterity, on film, of landscapes and types of environment that formed his consciousness ? The ecstatic energy consumed in the hotel bed between eleven o’clock in the morning when the Dutch Reformed church bells were tolling and midday when the xylophone notes of the lunch gong were sounded, an hour without any consequences whatever except a stain on the bottom sheet—stiff commemorative plaque that a Selena or Elsie would remark, without having her life altered in any manner, before it disappeared in the wash ?

And the black people don’t need anyone else. We don’t know about class interests. We’re one kind. Black.—    —Oh you’ve discovered something in your classroom at Turfloop ? Have you ever heard of Marcus Garvey ? Yes ?—    Orde Greer jolted attention swiftly back to Dhladhla.—But five minutes ago you said ‘those people’ were the greatest problem. The ones who’ll take exemption—in sport, or anywhere, the same thing and they’re the same people.—    —We don’t deny the problem. We just know that it cannot exist once we rouse the people to consciousness.—    —But it does exist at present... a possible future black exploiting class—all right, let’s not argue over terms—a group, a sector consisting of quite a considerable number of people. It exists. And the Americans, the British, the French, the West Germans—they wouldn’t object either, the Americans would certainly take the heat off at U.N. and in Congress if white South Africa were to opt for survival by taking in that black sector. What I’m asking is just this—could a capitalist society which throws overboard the race factor entirely still evolve here ?—    Voices went into the air like caps; from the schoolmaster, the host’s other friends, over the heads of the hangers-on who sipped from their beer cans and passed cigarettes between them.

Who else did they visit as well as Hlubi’s outfit ?—    He was stiffly dignified with his red socks sagging over the boots, his hand feeling masturbatorily round his back and chest under the pullover.    He had taken pictures; Colonel van Staden himself led the raid, that meant they were after something big; the intrepid news photographer had doubled up the fire escape and there was one shot of van Staden’s man, that lout Claasens——He’s holding some chap by the scruff of the neck like a dog, you can see he’s got him by a handful of jacket and shirt—man, his feet are practically lifted dangling off the ground—    —But what was happening? Resisting arrest ?—    —No—no—Claasens is searching him, with the other hand he’s in his pockets—you’ll see... But you won’t because my bloody editor won’t publish. He says to me, they’ll be down on us like a load of bricks. You’ll be in for it too.—You’re not allowed to show the police busy in any situation like that. Prejudicial to the dignity of the law. Their dignity. Christ.—    —Did Claasens see you’d caught him ?—    —I ran like hell. One of the others spotted me but when he came after he slipped on the metal steps, down on his backside, the bugger was lucky he didn’t fall four flights—    The baby on his grandmother’s lap shouted back gleefully at our laughter.
GordNBD.txt	270	60.0	1979	Gordimer, Nadine	Burger's daughter	  Nothing stopped me. Until the very last week I still thought I would stop myself. It’s difficult to believe that being too detached to see myself interesting to newspapers could have turned into a guarantee not to be interviewed by the hostile foreign press. It’s only too easy to be cold to the prospect of meetings in London with my father’s old associates in exile, who would receive me expectant as the old Terblanches and their daughter are; it hardly seemed to constitute an undertaking. And all I had to say about my brother, my father’s other son, was to observe that a South African passport isn’t recognized in Tanzania. The remark put him as far from me as if he too drowned as a child, or like Baasie, my little kaffertjie, disappeared into some room, some black township, some prison, maybe, where I can’t catch up.    After I had taken the passport, after I’d gone—I don’t know what they said: the faithful. They would surely never have believed it of me. Perhaps they got out of believing it by substituting the explanation that I had gone on instructions, after all, instructions so daring and secret not even anyone among themselves would know. So my inactivity for so long would present them with a purpose they had always hoped for, for my sake. And by what means I had managed to get papers—that was simply a tribute to the lengths a revolutionary must go. I think about what they must be thinking. Listen to me—Conrad, whatever I may have said to you about them, however they may have seemed to me since I have been free of them, they are the ones who matter.

I had to dash after her with the eggs she left in the épicerie this morning. You don’t look too forbidding to me—A man’s voice with the precision of an English stage vicar, and a long, thick beardless face under a captain’s braided peak bent to the window.    —Yes, safe and sound—Rosa Burger, Constance Darby-Littleton. Are you walking up the hill... ?—    —Of course I want to walk. It’s my constitutional. I thought everyone was perfectly aware of my habits by now—Night-blue slits between puffy lids had no whites, no eyelashes, and moved from driver to passenger like mechanical eyes set in one of those anthropomorphic clock-faces. The car passed on at the level of matron’s breasts slung under a checked shirt.    In a parking ground scooped out below trees a fat young Bacchus wearing cement-stained cowboy boots leapt from a pick-up loaded with broken tiles and window-frames.—Madame Bagnelli—Loud, indignant and laughing exchange; not necessary to understand the language adequately to be able to follow that this was workman and client taking up some long-standing wrangle.—He came around and couldn’t get in! Now isn’t that just too bad! How many days I’ve waited in for nothing! I won’t see him for another six weeks and after another dozen phone-calls. He’s supposed to put a floor in my cave—rather the junk-pit that’s hopefully going to be a cave.

You call me Katya.—    On the gate there was a note under Scotch tape and a big dried sunflower like a dead burst star. MADAME BAGNELLI URGENT—exclamation mark scored within its outline. The gate dragged screeching across courtyard paving; the smell of stony damp and a perfume never smelled before; and then it brushed Rosa Burger’s face as the door was opened, the suitcase bumped through: lilac, real European lilac.    —Dah-dah-dah-dah; dedah—well that can wait. Why the hell should I phone the moment I come in...—The note flew into a straw basket.—You want to go straight up ? No—let’s just dump everything. I’ve got a little (swimming colours, fronds blobbing out of focus and a sea horizon undulating in uneven panes of glass)—just a little something ready—the glass doors shook open, the new arrival was on a leafy shelf of sun, offered to the sea midway between sky and tumbling terraces of little dark trees decorated with oranges. She smelled cats and geranium. The elaborate toy villas of the dead in a steep cemetery took on their façades the light off the sea. She felt it on her cheeks and eyelids. She saw—saw a crack up a white urn that was a line of ants, a tiny boat like a fingernail scored across the sea, saw the varicose vein wriggling up behind the knee of the ex-dancer putting down the tray with the bottle of champagne in a bucket.

His contribution to proper appreciation of the guest of honour was instinctively to take on a role in keeping with the position of Donna as the host of James Chelmsford. Chelmsford himself was got up in shirt-sleeves, blue linen trousers, espadrilles showing thick, pallid blue-veined ankles, yellow Liberty scarf under a shinily-shaven red face, drinking pastis; making it clear he was no newcomer to this part of the world. Donna shepherded round him a little group that included Rosa. It attracted one or two others who had opinions to solicit as an opening to giving their own—a journalist from Paris who was someone else’s house-guest, a constructional engineer from the Société des Grands Travaux de Marseille.

In the Leftist view of life, anyway, the two are as one, more or less, aren’t they, they’re always insisting their ‘freedom’ is the condition of happiness.—    She weighed empty hands a moment—Bernard saw what was underfoot taken up and shown there—then hid fists behind her thighs.—Don’t you know ? There isn’t the possibility of happiness without institutions to protect it.—    The Englishman smiled on a grille of tiny teeth holding a cigar. —God in heaven help us! And up goes the barbed wire, and who knows when you first discover which is the wrong side—    —I’m not offering a theory. I’m talking about people who need to have rights—there—in a statute book, so that they can move about in their own country, decide what work they’ll do and what their children will learn at school. So that they can get onto a bus or walk in somewhere and order a cup of coffee.—    —Oh well, ordinary civil rights. That’s hardly utopia. You don’t need a revolution for that.—    —In some countries you do. People die for such things.—Bernard spoke aloud to himself.

I just want to get my kids out, that’s all.—She began to talk of some of the things she had seen at the hospital, not in her department: a little girl who had lost an eye; she was used to working with horrors (she used the word ‘deformities’) about which something could be done—nerves slowly brought back to feeling, muscles strengthened to flex again. —The left eye. Seven or eight years old. Gone for good.—She was not able to describe the black hole, the void she was seeing where the eye ought to be.—Last week the man who lives in the next house to us—you know our place ? you’ve been there with Marisa—just there, the next house, he went out to buy something at the shop, candles, something his mother wanted. Never came back. She came over—she says, what must she do ? Go to the police, my wife told her, ask them where he is—she thought he’s arrested.

But when later Rosa Burger became an awaiting-trial prisoner she was entitled to the privileges of that status, and in the absence of any blood relative, Flora Donaldson sought and was given permission to see her. Other applicants were refused, with the single exception of Brandt Vermeulen who, no doubt through influence in high places, was suddenly there, when Rosa was taken to the visitors’ room one day. These were not contact visits; Rosa received her visitors from behind a wire grille. It is not known what Brandt Vermeulen talked about in the category of ‘domestic matters’ to which the subject of prison conversations is confined, under surveillance of attendant warders. He is a fluent, amusing talker and a broadminded man of many interests, anyway, not likely to be at a loss. Flora reported that Rosa ‘hadn’t changed much’. She remarked on this to her husband, William.—She’s all right. In good shape. She looked like a little girl, I gather Leela Govind or somebody’s cut her hair again for her, just to here, in her neck... About fourteen... except she’s somehow livelier than she used to be. In a way. Less reserved. We joke a lot—that’s something the bloody warders find hard to follow. After all, why shouldn’t family matters be funny ? They’re boring enough.

It bore the stamp of the Prisons Department in Pretoria but this aroused no interest in the handsome postman who stopped in for a pernod when he delivered the mail, because he could not read English and did not know where Pretoria was. In a passage dealing with the comforts of a cell as if describing the features of a tourist hotel that wasn’t quite what the brochure might have suggested—I have rigged up out of fruit boxes a sort of Japanese-style portable desk (remember the one old Ivan Poliakoff had, the one he used when he wrote in bed) and that’s what I’m writing at now—there was a reference to a watermark of light that came into the cell at sundown every evening, reflected from some west-facing surface outside; something Lionel Burger once mentioned. But the line had been deleted by the prison censor. Madame Bagnelli was never able to make it out.

"Ho, Diomed, well met! Do you sup with Glaucus tonight  ?" said a young man of small stature, who wore his  tunic in those loose and effeminate folds which proved him to  be a gentleman and a coxcomb.  " Alas, no! dear Clodius; he has not invited me, " replied  Diomed, a man of portly frame and of middle age. " By  Pollux, a scurvy trick! for they say his suppers are the best  in Pompeii."  " Pretty well; though there is never enough of wine for me.  It is not the old Greek blood that flows in his veins, for he  pretends that wine makes him dull the next morning."  "There may be another reason for that thrift, " said Diomed,  raising his brows. " With all his conceit and extravagance he  is not so rich, I fancy, as he affects to be, and perhaps loves  to save his amphorae better than his wit."  4 THE LAST DAYS OF POMPEII.

" He is fond of every pleasure; and while he likes the  pleasure of giving suppers, we are all fond of him."  " Ha, ha, Clodius, that is well said! Have you ever seen  my wine cellars, by the bye ? "  " I think not, my good Diomed."  " Well, you must sup with me some evening; I have tolerable  murEenae l in my reservoir, and I will ask Pansa the aedile  to meet you."  " Oh, no state with me! Persicos odi apparatus, I am easily  contented. Well, the day wanes; I am for the baths — and  you — "  "To the quaestor — business of state — afterwards to the  temple of Isis. Vale!"  "An ostentatious, bustling, ill-bred fellow, " muttered Clodius  to himself, as he sauntered slowly away. "He thinks  with his feasts and his wine cellars to make us forget that he  is the sou of a freedman; and so he will, when we do him  the honour of winning his money: these rich plebeians are a  harvest for us spendthrift nobles."  Thus soliloquizing, Clodius arrived in the Yia Domitiana,  which was crowded with passengers and chariots, and exhibited  all that gay and animated exuberance of life and motion  which we find at this day in the streets of Naples.  The bells of the cars, as they rapidly glided by each other,  jingled merrily on the ear, and Clodius, with smiles or nods,  claimed familiar acquaintance with whatever equipage was  most elegant or fantastic; in fact, no idler was better known  in Pompeii.

" You flatter me, my Clodius, indeed you do, " quoth the  aedile, who was celebrated through Pompeii for having the  worst paintings in the world; for he was patriotic, and patronised  none but Pompeians. " You flatter me ; but there is  something pretty — Edepol! yes — in the colours, to say nothing  of the design; and then for the kitchen, my friends —  ah ! that was all my fancy."  " What is the design ? " said Glaucus. " I have not yet  seen your kitchen, though I have often witnessed the excellence  of its cheer."  "A cook, my Athenian, — a cook sacrificing the trophies of  his skill on the altar of Vesta, with a beautiful muraena (taken  from the life) on a spit at a distance; there is some invention  there!"

Recoiling before that gaze, with a strange fear which she  could not explain, the Neapolitan answered with confusion and  hesitation: " He was brought to my house as a countryman of  my father's, and I may say of mine. I have known him only  within this last week or so; but why these questions ? "  "Forgive me, " said Arbaces; "I thought you might have  known him longer, — base insinuator that he is I"  " How ! what mean you ? Why that term ? "  " It matters not; let me not rouse your indignation against  one who does not deserve so grave an honour."  "I implore you speak. What has Glaucus insinuated; or  rather, in what do you suppose he has offended ? "  Smothering his resentment at the last part of Tone's question,  Arbaces continued: " You know his pursuits, his companions,  his habits: the comissatio and the alea (the revel and  the dice) make his occupation; and amongst the associates of  vice how can he dream of virtue ?

Moved by her forlorn situation, her appeal to him, her own  innumerable and touching graces, the Greek seated himself on  108 THE LAST DAYS OF POMPEIL  one of the rude chairs. He held her on his knees, he wiped  the blood from her shoulders with his long hair, he kissed the  tears from her cheeks, he whispered to her a thousand of  those soothing words with which we calm the grief of a child;  and so beautiful did he seem in his gentle and consoling task,  that even the fierce heart of Stratonice was touched. His  presence seemed to shed light over that base and obsceue  haunt; young, beautiful, glorious, he was the emblem of all  that earth made most happy, comforting one that the earth  had abandoned!

Do you know, Celcinus, that this fellow, passing by my  shop the other day, and seeing me employed on a statue of  Minerva, told me with a frown that, had it been marble, he  would have broken it; but the bronze was too strong for him.  ' Break a goddess!' said I. ' A goddess !' answered the atheist;  'it is a demon, an evil spirit!' Then he passed on his way  cursing. Are such things to be born ?

While such were the friendly remarks provoked by the air  and faith of the Nazarene, Olinthus himself became sensible  of the effect he was producing; he turned his eyes round, and  observed the intent faces of the accumulating throng, whispering  as they gazed; and surveying them for a moment with an  expression, first of defiance and afterwards of compassion, he  gathered his cloak round him and passed on, muttering audibly,  " Deluded idolaters ! did not last night's convulsion warn  ye ?

"  " Of love !" repeated Nydia, raising her large, wandering  eyes, that ever thrilled those who saw them with a mingled  fear and pity; you could never familiarise yourself to their  aspect: so strange did it seem that those dark wild orbs were  ignorant of the day, and either so fixed was their deep mysterious  gaze, or so restless and perturbed their glance, that you  felt, when you encountered them, that same vague and chilling  and half preternatural impression which comes over you  in the presence of the insane, — of those who, having a life  outwardly like your own, have a life within life, dissimilar,  unsearchable, unguessed!  " Will you that I should sing of love ? " said she, fixing  those eyes upon Glaucus.  " Yes, " replied he, looking down.

"Sallust, " said Arbaces, gravely, "there is much in thy  friend's case that merits a peculiar indulgence ; and could we  learn from his lips the confession and the cause of his crime,  much might be yet hoped from the mercy of the senate ; for  the senate, thou knowest, hath the power either to mitigate or  to sharpen the law. Therefore it is that I have conferred with  the highest authority of the city, and obtained his permission  to hold a private conference this night with the Athenian.  tomorrow, thou knowest, the trial comes on."  " Well, " said Sallust, " thou wilt be worthy of thy Eastern  name and fame if thou canst learn aught from him ; but thou  mayest try. Poor Glaucus! And he had such an excellent  appetite !

But compassion itself came too late. Had  lone even pledged him her hand as his reward, he could not  now, his evidence given, the populace excited, have saved the  Athenian. Still, made sanguine by his very energy of mind,  he threw himself on the chances of the future, and believed he  THE LAST DAYS OF POMPEII 187  should yet triumph over the woman that had so entangled his  passions.  As his attendants assisted to unrobe him for the night, the  thought of Nydia flashed across him. He felt it was necessary  that lone should never learn of her lover's frenzy, lest it might  excuse his imputed crime; and it was possible that her attendants  might inform her that Nydia was under his roof, and she  might desire to see her. As this idea crossed him, he turned  to one of his freedmen, —  " Go, Callias, " said he, " forthwith to Sosia, and tell him that  on no pretence is he to suffer the blind slave Nydia out of her  chamber.

Strong palings at these passages prevented  any unwelcome eccentricity in the movements of the  beasts, and confined them to their appointed prey. Around  the parapet which was raised above the arena, and from which  the seats gradually rose, were gladiatorial inscriptions, and  paintings wrought in fresco, typical of the entertainments for  which the place was designed. Throughout the whole building  wound invisible pipes, from which, as the day advanced, cooling  and fragrant showers were to be sprinkled over the spectators.  The officers of the amphitheatre were still employed  in the task of fixing the vast awning (or velaria) which covered  the whole, and which luxurious invention the Campanians  arrogated to themselves : it was woven of the whitest Apulian  wool, and variegated with broad stripes of crimson. Owing  either to some inexperience on the part of the workmen, or to  some defect in the machinery, the awning, however, was not  arranged that day so happily as usual: indeed, from the immense  space of the circumference, the task was always one of  great difficulty and art; so much so, that it could seldom be  adventured in rough or windy weather 15ut the present day  was so remarkably still that there seemed to the spectators no  excuse for the awkwardness of the artificers; and when a  large gap in the back of the awning was still visible, from the  obstinate refusal of one part of the velaria to ally itself with  the rest, the murmurs of discontent were loud and general.

The people  saw and shuddered.  " It is a god that inspires the holy man! To the lion with  the Egyptian!"  With that cry up sprang, on moved, thousands upon thousands  ! They rushed from the heights; they poured down in  the direction of the Egyptian. In vain did the aedile command  ; in vain did the praetor lift his voice and proclaim the  law. The people had been already rendered savage by the  exhibition of blood ; they thirsted for more; their superstition  was aided by their ferocity. Aroused, inflamed by the spectacle  of their victims, they forgot the authority of their rulers.  It was one of those dread popular convulsions common to  crowds wholly ignorant, half free and half servile; and which  the peculiar constitution of the Roman provinces so frequently  exhibited. The power of the praetor was as a reed beneath  the whirlwind; still, at his word the guards had drawn themselves  along the lower benches, on which the upper classes sat  separate from the vulgar. They made but a feeble barrier;  the waves of the human sea halted for a moment, to enable  Arbaces to count the exact moment of his doom ! In despair,  and in a terror which beat down even pride, he glanced his  eyes over the rolling and rushing crowd, when, right above  them, through the wide chasm which had been left in the  velaria, he beheld a strange and awful apparition; he beheld,  and his craft restored his courage ! 
LyttEL.txt	620	60.0	1834	Lytton, Edward Bulwer	Last Days of Pompeii	Meanwhile the streets were already thinned ; the crowd had  hastened to disperse itself under shelter; the ashes began to  fill up the lower parts of the town; but here and there you  heard the steps of fugitives cranching them warily, or saw  their pale and haggard faces by the blue glare of the lightning,  or the more unsteady glare of torches, by which they endeavoured  to steer their steps. But ever and anon the boiling water,  or the straggling ashes, mysterious and gusty winds, rising and  dying in a breath, extinguished these wandering lights, and  with them the last living hope of those who bore them.  In the street that leads to the gate of Herculaneum, Clodius  now bent his perplexed and doubtful way. " If I can gain the  open country, " thought he, "doubtless there will be various    THE LAST DAYS OF POMPEII. 207  vehicles beyond the gate, and Herculaneum is not far distant.  Thank Mercury! I have little to lose, and that little is  about me!"  " Holloa! help there, — help !" cried a querulous and frightened  voice. " I have fallen down, my torch has gone out, my  slaves have deserted me. I am Diomed, — the rich Diomed;  ten thousand sesterces to him who helps me!"  At the same moment Clodius felt himself caught by the  feet. " ll fortune to thee; let me go, fool!" said the gambler.  " Oh, help me up! give me thy hand!"  " There, rise!"

There were jewels and coins, candelabra for  unavailing light, and wine hardened in the amphorae for a  prolongation of agonised life. The sand, consolidated by  ikunps, had taken the forms of the skeletons as in a cast;  and the traveller may yet see the impression of a female neck  and bosom of young and round proportions, — the trace of the  fated Julia ! It seems to the inquirer as if the air had been  gradually changed into a sulphurous vapour; the inmates of  the vaults had rushed to the door, to find it closed and blocked  up by the scoria without, and in their attempts to force it had  been suffocated with the atmosphere.  In the garden was found a skeleton with a key by its bony  hand, and near it a bag of coins. This is believed to have  been the master of the house, — the unfortunate Diomed, who  had probably sought to escape by the garden, and been destroyed  either by the vapours or some fragment of stone.

The houses of Sallust and of Pansa, the Temple of Isis, with  the juggling concealments behind the statues, — the lurking  place of its holy oracles, — are now bared to the gaze of the  curious. In one of the chambers of that temple was found a  huge skeleton with an axe beside it: two walls had been  pierced by the axe; the victim could penetrate no farther.  In the midst of the city was found another skeleton, by the  side of which was a heap of coins, and many of the mystic  ornaments of the fane of Isis.

Still, after the lapse of ages, the traveller may survey that  airy hall, within whose cunning galleries and elaborate chambers  once thought, reasoned, dreamed, and sinned, the soul of  Arbaces the Egyptian.

ChriAMR.txt	0	60.0	1926	Christie, Agatha	The murder of Roger Ackroyd	Agatha Christie      The Murder of Roger Ackroyd        One      DR. SHEPPARD AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE          Mrs. Ferrars died on the night of the 16th–17th September—a Thursday. I was sent for at eight o’clock on the morning of Friday the 17th. There was nothing to be done. She had been dead some hours.    It was just a few minutes after nine when I reached home once more. I opened the front door with my latchkey, and purposely delayed a few moments in the hall, hanging up my hat and the light overcoat that I had deemed a wise precaution against the chill of an early autumn morning. To tell the truth, I was considerably upset and worried. I am not going to pretend that at that moment I foresaw the events of the next few weeks. I emphatically did not do so. But my instinct told me that there were stirring times ahead.    From the dining room on my left there came the rattle of teacups and the short, dry cough of my sister Caroline.    “Is that you, James?” she called. 
ChriAMR.txt	1	0.4998	1926	Christie, Agatha	The murder of Roger Ackroyd	  An unnecessary question, since who else could it be? To tell the truth, it was precisely my sister Caroline who was the cause of my few minutes’ delay. The motto of the mongoose family, so Mr. Kipling tells us, is: “Go and find out.” If Caroline ever adopts a crest, I should certainly suggest a mongoose rampant. One might omit the first part of the motto. Caroline can do any amount of finding out by sitting placidly at home. I don’t know how she manages it, but there it is. I suspect that the servants and the tradesmen constitute her Intelligence Corps. When she goes out, it is not to gather in information, but to spread it. At that, too, she is amazingly expert.    It was really this last named trait of hers which was causing me these pangs of indecision. Whatever I told Caroline now concerning the demise of Mrs. Ferrars would be common knowledge all over the village within the space of an hour and a half. As a professional man, I naturally aim at discretion. Therefore I have got into the habit of continually withholding all information possible from my sister. She usually finds out just the same, but I have the moral satisfaction of knowing that I am in no way to blame.    Mrs. Ferrars’ husband died just over a year ago, and Caroline has constantly asserted, without the least foundation for the assertion, that his wife poisoned him. 
ChriAMR.txt	2	1.4994	1926	Christie, Agatha	The murder of Roger Ackroyd	  She scorns my invariable rejoinder that Mr. Ferrars died of acute gastritis, helped on by habitual overindulgence in alcoholic beverages. The symptoms of gastritis and arsenical poisoning are not, I agree, unlike, but Caroline bases her accusation on quite different lines.    “You’ve only got to look at her,” I have heard her say.    Mrs. Ferrars, though not in her first youth, was a very attractive woman, and her clothes, though simple, always seemed to fit her very well, but all the same, lots of women buy their clothes in Paris, and have not, on that account, necessarily poisoned their husbands.    As I stood hesitating in the hall, with all this passing through my mind, Caroline’s voice came again, with a sharper note in it.    “What on earth are you doing out there, James? Why don’t you come and get your breakfast?”    “Just coming, my dear,” I said hastily. “I’ve been hanging up my overcoat.”    “You could have hung up half a dozen overcoats in this time.”    She was quite right. I could have.    I walked into the dining room, gave Caroline the accustomed peck on the cheek, and sat down to eggs and bacon. The bacon was rather cold.    “You’ve had an early call,” remarked Caroline.    “Yes,” I said. “King’s Paddock. Mrs. Ferrars.”    “I know,” said my sister.    “How did you know?”    “Annie told me.”    Annie is the house parlourmaid. A nice girl, but an inveterate talker. 
ChriAMR.txt	24	2.0	1926	Christie, Agatha	The murder of Roger Ackroyd	  I went in. Caroline had her hat on, and had evidently just come in from the village. She began without preamble.    “I met Mr. Ackroyd.”    “Yes?” I said.    “I stopped him, of course, but he seemed in a great hurry, and anxious to get away.”    I have no doubt but that that was the case. He would feel towards Caroline much as he had felt towards Miss Gannett earlier in the day—perhaps more so. Caroline is less easy to shake off.    “I asked him at once about Ralph. He was absolutely astonished. Had no idea the boy was down here. He actually said he thought I must have made a mistake. I! A mistake!”    “Ridiculous,” I said. “He ought to have known you better.”    “Then he went on to tell me that Ralph and Flora are engaged.”    “I knew that, too,” I interrupted, with modest pride.    “Who told you?”    “Our new neighbour.”    Caroline visibly wavered for a second or two, much as if a roulette ball might coyly hover between two numbers. Then she declined the tempting red herring.    “I told Mr. Ackroyd that Ralph was staying at the Three Boars.”    “Caroline,” I said, “do you never reflect that you might do a lot of harm with this habit of yours of repeating everything indiscriminately?”    “Nonsense,” said my sister. “People ought to know things. I consider it my duty to tell them. Mr. Ackroyd was very grateful to me.”    “Well,” I said, for there was clearly more to come. 
ChriAMR.txt	47	180.0	1926	Christie, Agatha	The murder of Roger Ackroyd	  “This the way to Fernly Park, mister?” asked the stranger in a hoarse voice.    I looked at him. He was wearing a hat pulled down over his eyes, and his coat collar turned up. I could see little or nothing of his face, but he seemed a young fellow. The voice was rough and uneducated.    “These are the lodge gates here,” I said.    “Thank you, mister.” He paused, and then added, quite unnecessarily, “I’m a stranger in these parts, you see.”    He went on, passing through the gates as I turned to look after him.    The odd thing was that his voice reminded me of someone’s voice that I knew, but whose it was I could not think.    Ten minutes later I was at home once more. Caroline was full of curiosity to know why I had returned so early. I had to make up a slightly fictitious account of the evening in order to satisfy her, and I had an uneasy feeling that she saw through the transparent device.    At ten o’clock I rose, yawned, and suggested bed. Caroline acquiesced.    It was Friday night, and on Friday night I wind the clocks. I did it as usual, whilst Caroline satisfied herself that the servants had locked up the kitchen properly.    It was a quarter past ten as we went up the stairs. I had just reached the top when the telephone rang in the hall below. 
ChriAMR.txt	101	4.0	1926	Christie, Agatha	The murder of Roger Ackroyd	  “Une belle propriété,” he said at last appreciatively. “Who inherits it?”    His words gave me almost a shock. It is an odd thing, but until that moment the question of inheritance had never come into my head. Poirot watched me keenly.    “It is a new idea to you, that,” he said at last. “You had not thought of it before—eh?”    “No,” I said truthfully. “I wish I had.”    He looked at me again curiously.    “I wonder just what you mean by that,” he said thoughtfully. “Oh! no,” as I was about to speak. “Inutile! You would not tell me your real thought.”    “Everyone has something to hide,” I quoted, smiling.    “Exactly.”    “You still believe that?”    “More than ever, my friend. But it is not easy to hide things from Hercule Poirot. He has a knack of finding out.”    He descended the steps of the Dutch garden as he spoke.    “Let us walk a little,” he said over his shoulder. “The air is pleasant today.”    I followed him. He led me down a path to the left enclosed in yew hedges. A walk led down the middle, bordered each side with formal flower beds, and at the end was a round paved recess with a seat and a pond of goldfish. Instead of pursuing the path to the end, Poirot took another which wound up the side of a wooded slope. In one spot the trees had been cleared away, and a seat had been put. Sitting there one had a splendid view over the countryside, and one looked right down on the paved recess and the goldfish pond. 
ChriAMR.txt	124	20.0	1926	Christie, Agatha	The murder of Roger Ackroyd	  “H’m,” said he. “Reads all right. Mrs. Richard Folliott, Marby Grange, Marby. Who’s this woman?”    “Quite good country people,” said Miss Russell.    “Well,” said the inspector, handing it back, “let’s have a look at the other one, Elsie Dale.”    Elsie Dale was a big fair girl, with a pleasant but slightly stupid face. She answered our questions readily enough, and showed much distress and concern at the loss of the money.    “I don’t think there’s anything wrong with her,” observed the inspector, after he had dismissed her. “What about Parker?”    Miss Russell pursed her lips together and made no reply.    “I’ve a feeling there’s something wrong about that man,” the inspector continued thoughtfully. “The trouble is that I don’t quite see when he got his opportunity. He’d be busy with his duties immediately after dinner, and he’d got a pretty good alibi all through the evening. I know, for I’ve been devoting particular attention to it. Well, thank you very much, Miss Russell. We’ll leave things as they are for the present. It’s highly probable Mr. Ackroyd paid that money away himself.”    The housekeeper bade us a dry good afternoon, and we took our leave.    I left the house with Poirot.    “I wonder,” I said, breaking the silence, “what the papers the girl disarranged could have been for Ackroyd to have got into such a state about them? I wonder if there is any clue there to the mystery.”    “The secretary said there were no papers of particular importance on the desk,” said Poirot quietly. 
ChriAMR.txt	142	4.0	1926	Christie, Agatha	The murder of Roger Ackroyd	  When everyone was assembled, Poirot rose and bowed.    “Messieurs, mesdames, I have called you together for a certain purpose.” He paused. “To begin with, I want to make a very special plea to mademoiselle.”    “To me?” said Flora.    “Mademoiselle, you are engaged to Captain Ralph Paton. If anyone is in his confidence, you are. I beg you, most earnestly, if you know of his whereabouts, to persuade him to come forward. One little minute”—as Flora raised her head to speak—“say nothing till you have well reflected. Mademoiselle, his position grows daily more dangerous. If he had come forward at once, no matter how damning the facts, he might have had a chance of explaining them away. But this silence—this flight—what can it mean? Surely only one thing, knowledge of guilt. Mademoiselle, if you really believe in his innocence, persuade him to come forward before it is too late.”    Flora’s face had gone very white.    “Too late!” she repeated, very low.    Poirot leant forward, looking at her.    “See now, mademoiselle,” he said very gently, “it is Papa Poirot who asks you this. The old Papa Poirot who has much knowledge and much experience. I would not seek to entrap you, mademoiselle. Will you not trust me—and tell me where Ralph Paton is hiding?”    The girl rose and stood facing him. 
ChriAMR.txt	156	600.0	1926	Christie, Agatha	The murder of Roger Ackroyd	  As I say, up till the Monday evening, my narrative might have been that of Poirot himself. I played Watson to his Sherlock. But after Monday our ways diverged. Poirot was busy on his own account. I got to hear of what he was doing, because in King’s Abbot you get to hear of everything, but he did not take me into his confidence beforehand. And I, too, had my own preoccupations.    On looking back, the thing that strikes me most is the piecemeal character of this period. Everyone had a hand in the elucidation of the mystery. It was rather like a jig-saw puzzle to which everyone contributed their own little piece of knowledge or discovery. But their task ended there. To Poirot alone belongs the renown of fitting those pieces into their correct place.    Some of the incidents seemed at the time irrelevant and unmeaning. There was, for instance, the question of the black boots. But that comes later…. To take things strictly in chronological order, I must begin with the summons from Mrs. Ackroyd.    She sent for me early on Tuesday morning, and since the summons sounded an urgent one, I hastened there, expecting to find her in extremis.    The lady was in bed. So much did she concede to the etiquette of the situation. She gave me her bony hand, and indicated a chair drawn up to the bedside. 
ChriAMR.txt	173	2.0	1926	Christie, Agatha	The murder of Roger Ackroyd	  I would have catechized him further, for I did not quite understand his meaning, but at that moment the door opened and Geoffrey Raymond was announced.    He came in fresh and debonair as ever, and greeted us both.    “How are you, doctor? M. Poirot, this is the second time I’ve been here this morning. I was anxious to catch you.”    “Perhaps I’d better be off,” I suggested rather awkwardly.    “Not on my account, doctor. No, it’s just this,” he went on, seating himself at a wave of invitation from Poirot, “I’ve got a confession to make.”    “En verité?” said Poirot, with an air of polite interest.    “Oh, it’s of no consequence, really. But, as a matter of fact, my conscience has been pricking me ever since yesterday afternoon. You accused us all of keeping back something, M. Poirot. I plead guilty. I’ve had something up my sleeve.”    “And what is that, M. Raymond?”    “As I say, it’s nothing of consequence—just this. I was in debt—badly, and that legacy came in the nick of time. Five hundred pounds puts me on my feet again with a little to spare.”    He smiled at us both with that engaging frankness that made him such a likeable youngster. 
ChriAMR.txt	184	2.0	1926	Christie, Agatha	The murder of Roger Ackroyd	  “This M. Poirot now,” said Colonel Carter, “is he really such a great detective?”    “The greatest the world has ever known,” said Caroline solemnly. “He has to come here incognito to avoid publicity.”    “Chow,” said Miss Gannett. “Quite wonderful for our little village, I’m sure. By the way, Clara—my maid, you know—is great friends with Elsie, the housemaid at Fernly, and what do you think Elsie told her? That there’s been a lot of money stolen, and it’s her opinion—Elsie’s, I mean—that the parlourmaid had something to do with it. She’s leaving at the month, and she’s crying a good deal at night. If you ask me, the girl is very likely in league with a gang. She’s always been a queer girl—she’s not friends with any of the girls round here. She goes off by herself on her days out—very unnatural, I call it, and most suspicious. I asked her once to come to our Friendly Girls’ Evenings, but she refused, and then I asked her a few questions about her home and her family—all that sort of thing, and I’m bound to say I considered her manner most impertinent. Outwardly very respectful—but she shut me up in the most barefaced way.”    Miss Gannett stopped for breath, and the colonel, who was totally uninterested in the servant question, remarked that in the Shanghai Club brisk play was the invariable rule.    We had a round of brisk play. 
ChriAMR.txt	185	3.0	1926	Christie, Agatha	The murder of Roger Ackroyd	  “That Miss Russell,” said Caroline. “She came here pretending to consult James on Friday morning. It’s my opinion she wanted to see where the poisons were kept. Five Characters.”    “Chow,” said Miss Gannett. “What an extraordinary idea! I wonder if you can be right.”    “Talking of poisons,” said the colonel. “Eh—what? Haven’t I discarded? Oh! Eight Bamboos.”    “Mah Jong!” said Miss Gannett.    Caroline was very much annoyed.    “One Red Dragon,” she said regretfully, “and I should have had a hand of three doubles.”    “I’ve had two Red Dragons all the time,” I mentioned.    “So exactly like you, James,” said Caroline reproachfully. “You’ve no conception of the spirit of the game.”    I myself thought I had played rather cleverly. I should have had to pay Caroline an enormous amount if she had gone Mah Jong. Miss Gannett’s Mah Jong was of the poorest variety possible, as Caroline did not fail to point out to her.    East Wind passed, and we started a new hand in silence.    “What I was going to tell you just now was this,” said Caroline.    “Yes?” said Miss Gannett encouragingly.    “My idea about Ralph Paton, I mean.”    “Yes, dear,” said Miss Gannett, still more encouragingly. “Chow!”    “It’s a sign of weakness to Chow so early,” said Caroline severely. “You should go for a big hand.”    “I know,” said Miss Gannett. “You were saying—about Ralph Paton, you know?”    “Yes. Well, I’ve a pretty shrewd idea where he is.”    We all stopped to stare at her. 
ChriAMR.txt	202	2.0	1926	Christie, Agatha	The murder of Roger Ackroyd	  “Eight years older. And I’ve always considered it my duty to look after you. With a bad bringing up, Heaven knows what mischief you might have got into by now.”    “I might have married a beautiful adventuress,” I murmured, gazing at the ceiling, and blowing smoke rings.    “Adventuress!” said Caroline, with a snort. “If we’re talking of adventuresses—”    She left the sentence unfinished.    “Well?” I said, with some curiosity.    “Nothing. But I can think of someone not a hundred miles away.”    Then she turned to Poirot suddenly.    “James sticks to it that you believe someone in the house committed the murder. All I can say is, you’re wrong.”    “I should not like to be wrong,” said Poirot. “It is not—how do you say—my métier?”    “I’ve got the facts pretty clearly,” continued Caroline, taking no notice of Poirot’s remark, “from James and others. As far as I can see, of the people in the house, only two could have had the chance of doing it. Ralph Paton and Flora Ackroyd.”    “My dear Caroline—”    “Now, James, don’t interrupt me. I know what I’m talking about. Parker met her outside the door, didn’t he? He didn’t hear her uncle saying goodnight to her. She could have killed him then and there.”    “Caroline!”    “I’m not saying she did, James. I’m saying she could have done.
ChriAMR.txt	267	2.0	1926	Christie, Agatha	The murder of Roger Ackroyd	  “But yes,” said Poirot, nodding encouragingly, “on Wednesday. The young man was not of himself important. But the firm he represented interested me very much.”    “The Dictaphone Company,” gasped Raymond. “I see it now. A dictaphone. That’s what you think?”    Poirot nodded.    “Mr. Ackroyd had promised to invest in a dictaphone, you remember. Me, I had the curiosity to inquire of the company in question. Their reply is that Mr. Ackroyd did purchase a dictaphone from their representative. Why he concealed the matter from you, I do not know.”    “He must have meant to surprise me with it,” murmured Raymond. “He had quite a childish love of surprising people. Meant to keep it up his sleeve for a day or so. Probably was playing with it like a new toy. Yes, it fits in. You’re quite right—no one would use quite those words in casual conversation.”    “It explains, too,” said Poirot, “why Major Blunt thought it was you who were in the study. Such scraps as came to him were fragments of dictation, and so his subconscious mind deduced that you were with him. His conscious mind was occupied with something quite different—the white figure he had caught a glimpse of. He fancied it was Miss Ackroyd. Really, of course, it was Ursula Bourne’s white apron he saw as she was stealing down to the summerhouse.”    Raymond had recovered from his first surprise. 
ChriAMR.txt	290	2.0	1926	Christie, Agatha	The murder of Roger Ackroyd	  I must admit that it gave me rather a shock to run into Parker just outside the door. I have faithfully recorded that fact.    Then later, when the body was discovered, and I sent Parker to telephone for the police, what a judicious use of words: “I did what little had to be done!” It was quite little—just to shove the dictaphone into my bag and push back the chair against the wall in its proper place. I never dreamed that Parker would have noticed that chair. Logically, he ought to have been so agog over the body as to be blind to everything else. But I hadn’t reckoned with the trained servant complex.    I wish I could have known beforehand that Flora was going to say she’d seen her uncle alive at a quarter to ten. That puzzled me more than I can say. In fact, all through the case there have been things that puzzled me hopelessly. Everyone seems to have taken a hand.    My greatest fear all through has been Caroline. I have fancied she might guess. Curious the way she spoke that day of my “strain of weakness.”    Well, she will never know the truth. There is, as Poirot said, one way out….    I can trust him. He and Inspector Raglan will manage it between them. I should not like Caroline to know. She is fond of me, and then, too, she is proud…My death will be a grief to her, but grief passes….

And then—what shall it be? Veronal? There would be a kind of poetic justice. Not that I take any responsibility for Mrs. Ferrars’s death. It was the direct consequence of her own actions. I feel no pity for her.    I have no pity for myself either.    So let it be Veronal.

One guy I knew really was shot in Dresden for taking a teapot that wasn’t his. Another guy I knew really did threaten to have his personal enemies killed by hired gunmen after the war. And so on. I’ve changed all the names.    I really did go back to Dresden with Guggenheim money (God love it) in 1967. It looked a lot like Dayton, Ohio, more open spaces than Dayton has. There must be tons of human bone meal in the ground.    I went back there with an old war buddy, Bernard V. O’Hare, and we made friends with a cab driver, who took us to the slaughterhouse where we had been locked up at night as prisoners of war. His name was Gerhard Müller. He told us that he was a prisoner of the Americans for a while. We asked him how it was to live under Communism, and he said that it was terrible at first, because everybody had to work so hard, and because there wasn’t much shelter or food or clothing. But things were much better now. He had a pleasant little apartment, and his daughter was getting an excellent education. His mother was incinerated in the Dresden fire-storm. So it goes.

When I got home from the Second World War twenty-three years ago, I thought it would be easy for me to write about the destruction of Dresden, since all I would have to do would be to report what I had seen. And I thought, too, that it would be a masterpiece or at least make me a lot of money, since the subject was so big.    But not many words about Dresden came from my mind then—not enough of them to make a book, anyway. And not many words come now, either, when I have become an old fart with his memories and his Pall Malls, with his sons full grown. 
VoneKSF.txt	9	2.0	1969	Vonnegut, Kurt	Slaughterhouse Five	  When I got back to the office, the woman writer asked me, just for her own information, what the squashed guy had looked like when he was squashed.    I told her.    “Did it bother you?” she said. She was eating a Three Musketeers Candy Bar.    “Heck no, Nancy,” I said. “I’ve seen lots worse than that in the war.”    ***    Even then I was supposedly writing a book about Dresden. It wasn’t a famous air raid back then in America. Not many Americans knew how much worse it had been than Hiroshima, for instance. I didn’t know that, either. There hadn’t been much publicity.    I happened to tell a University of Chicago professor at a cocktail party about the raid as I had seen it, about the book I would write. He was a member of a thing called The Committee on Social Thought. And he told me about the concentration camps, and about how the Germans had made soap and candles out of the fat of dead Jews and so on. All I could say was, “I know, I know. I know.”    World War Two had certainly made everybody very tough. And I became a public relations man for General Electric in Schenectady, New York, and a volunteer fireman in the village of Alplaus, where I bought my first home. My boss there was one of the toughest guys I ever hope to meet. He had been a lieutenant colonel in public relations in Baltimore. While I was in Schenectady he joined the Dutch Reformed Church, which is a very tough church, indeed. 
VoneKSF.txt	23	2.0	1969	Vonnegut, Kurt	Slaughterhouse Five	  ***    He was treated in a veteran’s hospital near Lake Placid, and was given shock treatments and released. He married his fiancée, finished his education, and was set up in business in Ilium by his father-in-law. Ilium is a particularly good city for optometrists because the General Forge and Foundry Company is there. Every employee is required to own a pair of safety glasses, and to wear them in areas where manufacturing is going on. GF&F has sixty-eight thousand employees in Ilium. That calls for a lot of lenses and a lot of frames.    Frames are where the money is.    ***    Billy became rich. He had two children, Barbara and Robert. In time, his daughter Barbara married another optometrist, and Billy set him up in business. Billy’s son Robert had a lot of trouble in high school, but then he joined the famous Green Berets. He straightened out, became a fine young man, and he fought in Vietnam.    Early in 1968, a group of optometrists, with Billy among them, chartered an airplane to fly them from Ilium to an international convention of optometrists in Montreal. The plane crashed on top of Sugarbush Mountain, in Vermont. Everybody was killed but Billy. So it goes.    While Billy was recuperating in a hospital in Vermont, his wife died accidentally of carbon-monoxide poisoning. So it goes.

Roland Weary, eighteen years old, insinuated himself between the scouts, draped a heavy arm around the shoulder of each. “So what do the Three Musketeers do now?” he said.    Billy Pilgrim was having a delightful hallucination. He was wearing dry, warm, white sweatsocks, and he was skating on a ballroom floor. Thousands cheered. This wasn’t time-travel. It had never happened, never would happen. It was the craziness of a dying young man with his shoes full of snow.    One scout hung his head, let spit fall from his lips. The other did the same. They studied the infinitesimal effects of spit on snow and history. They were small, graceful people. They had been behind German lines before many times—living like woods creatures, living from moment to moment in useful terror, thinking brainlessly with their spinal cords.    Now they twisted out from under Weary’s loving arms. They told Weary that he and Billy had better find somebody to surrender to. The scouts weren’t going to wait for them anymore.    And they ditched Weary and Billy in the creekbed.    ***    Billy Pilgrim went on skating, doing tricks in sweatsocks, tricks that most people would consider impossible—making turns, stopping on a dime and so on. The cheering went on, but its tone was altered as the hallucination gave way to time-travel. 
VoneKSF.txt	65	15.0	1969	Vonnegut, Kurt	Slaughterhouse Five	  One of them singled out Billy’s face for a moment, then focused at infinity again. There was a tiny plume of smoke at infinity. There was a battle there. People were dying there. So it goes.    And the sun went down, and Billy found himself bobbing in place in a railroad yard. There were rows and rows of boxcars waiting. They had brought reserves to the front. Now they were going to take prisoners into Germany’s interior.    Flashlight beams danced crazily.    ***    The Germans sorted out the prisoners according to rank. They put sergeants with sergeants, majors with majors, and so on. A squad of full colonels was halted near Billy. One of them had double pneumonia. He had a high fever and vertigo. As the railroad yard dipped and swooped around the colonel, he tried to hold himself steady by staring into Billy’s eyes.    The colonel coughed and coughed, and then he said to Billy, “You one of my boys?” This was a man who had lost an entire regiment, about forty-five hundred men—a lot of them children, actually. Billy didn’t reply. The question made no sense.    “What was your outfit?” said the colonel. He coughed and coughed. Every time he inhaled his lungs rattled like greasy paper bags.    Billy couldn’t remember the outfit he was from.    “You from the Four-fifty-first?”    “Four-fifty-first what?” said Billy.    There was a silence. “Infantry regiment,” said the colonel at last. 
VoneKSF.txt	71	4.0	1969	Vonnegut, Kurt	Slaughterhouse Five	  There was a full moon.    Billy got out of bed in the moonlight. He felt spooky and luminous, felt as though he were wrapped in cool fur that was full of static electricity. He looked down at his bare feet. They were ivory and blue.    ***    Billy now shuffled down his upstairs hallway, knowing he was about to be kidnapped by a flying saucer. The hallway was zebra-striped with darkness and moonlight. The moonlight came into the hallway through doorways of the empty rooms of Billy’s two children, children no more. They were gone forever. Billy was guided by dread and the lack of dread. Dread told him when to stop. Lack of it told him when to move again. He stopped.    He went into his daughter’s room. Her drawers were dumped. Her closet was empty. Heaped in the middle of her room were all the possessions she could not take on a honeymoon. She had a Princess telephone extension all her own—on her windowsill. Its tiny night light stared at Billy. And then it rang.    Billy answered. There was a drunk on the other end. Billy could almost smell his breath—mustard gas and roses. It was a wrong number. Billy hung up. There was a soft drink bottle on the windowsill. Its label boasted that it contained no nourishment whatsoever. 
VoneKSF.txt	98	20160.0	1969	Vonnegut, Kurt	Slaughterhouse Five	  They didn’t think it had anything to do with the war. They were sure Billy was going to pieces because his father had thrown him into the deep end of the Y.M.C.A. swimming pool when he was a little boy, and had then taken him to the rim of the Grand Canyon.    The man assigned to the bed next to Billy’s was a former infantry captain named Eliot Rosewater. Rosewater was sick and tired of being drunk all the time.    It was Rosewater who introduced Billy to science fiction, and in particular to the writings of Kilgore Trout. Rosewater had a tremendous collection of science-fiction paperbacks under his bed. He had brought them to the hospital in a steamer trunk. Those beloved, frumpish books gave off a smell that permeated the ward—like flannel pajamas that hadn’t been changed for a month, or like Irish stew.    Kilgore Trout became Billy’s favorite living author, and science fiction became the only sort of tales he could read.    Rosewater was twice as smart as Billy, but he and Billy were dealing with similar crises in similar ways. They had both found life meaningless, partly because of what they had seen in war. Rosewater, for instance, had shot a fourteen-year-old fireman, mistaking him for a German soldier. So it goes. And Billy had seen the greatest massacre in European history, which was the fire-bombing of Dresden. So it goes.    So they were trying to re-invent themselves and their universe. Science fiction was a big help. 
VoneKSF.txt	99	1.0	1969	Vonnegut, Kurt	Slaughterhouse Five	  ***    Rosewater said an interesting thing to Billy one time about a book that wasn’t science fiction. He said that everything there was to know about life was in The Brothers Karamazov, by Feodor Dostoevsky. “But that isn’t enough any more,” said Rosewater.    ***    Another time Billy heard Rosewater say to a psychiatrist, “I think you guys are going to have to come up with a lot of wonderful new lies, or people just aren’t going to want to go on living.”    ***    There was a still life on Billy’s bedside table—two pills, an ashtray with three lipstick-stained cigarettes in it, one cigarette still burning, and a glass of water. The water was dead. So it goes. Air was trying to get out of that dead water. Bubbles were clinging to the walls of the glass, too weak to climb out.    The cigarettes belonged to Billy’s chainsmoking mother. She had sought the ladies’ room, which was off the ward for WACS and WAVES and SPARS and WAFS who had gone bananas. She would be back at any moment now.    Billy covered his head with his blanket again. He always covered his head when his mother came to see him in the mental ward—always got much sicker until she went away. It wasn’t that she was ugly, or had bad breath or a bad personality. She was a perfectly nice, standard-issue, brown-haired, white woman with a high-school education. 
VoneKSF.txt	127	1.4994	1969	Vonnegut, Kurt	Slaughterhouse Five	  Campbell told what the German experience with captured American enlisted men had been. They were known everywhere to be the most self-pitying, least fraternal, and dirtiest of all prisoners of war, said Campbell. They were incapable of concerted action on their own behalf. They despised any leader from among their own number, refused to follow or even listen to him, on the grounds that he was no better than they were, that he should stop putting on airs.    And so on. Billy Pilgrim went to sleep, woke up as a widower in his empty home in Ilium. His daughter Barbara was reproaching him for writing ridiculous letters to the newspapers.    ***    “Did you hear what I said?” Barbara inquired. It was 1968 again.    “Of course.” He had been dozing.    “If you’re going to act like a child, maybe we’ll just have to treat you like a child.”    “That isn’t what happens next,” said Billy.    “We’ll see what happens next.” Big Barbara now embraced herself. “It’s awfully cold in here. Is the heat on?”    “The heat?”    “The furnace—the thing in the basement, the thing that makes hot air that comes out of these registers. I don’t think it’s working.”    “Maybe not.”    “Aren’t you cold?”    “I hadn’t noticed.”    “Oh my God, you are a child. If we leave you alone here, you’ll freeze to death, you’ll starve to death.” And so on. It was very exciting for her, taking his dignity away in the name of love. 
VoneKSF.txt	128	30.0	1969	Vonnegut, Kurt	Slaughterhouse Five	  ***    Barbara called the oil-burner man, and she made Billy go to bed, made him promise to stay under the electric blanket until the heat came on. She set the control of the blanket at the highest notch, which soon made Billy’s bed hot enough to bake bread in.    When Barbara left, slamming the door behind her, Billy traveled in time to the zoo on Tralfamadore again. A mate had just been brought to him from Earth. She was Montana Wildhack, a motion picture star.    ***    Montana was under heavy sedation. Tralfamadorians wearing gas masks brought her in, put her on Billy’s yellow lounge chair; withdrew through his airlock. The vast crowd outside was delighted. All attendance records for the zoo were broken. Everybody on the planet wanted to see the Earthlings mate.    Montana was naked, and so was Billy, of course. He had a tremendous wang, incidentally. You never know who’ll get one.    ***    Now she fluttered her eyelids. Her lashes were like buggy whips. “Where am I?” she said.    “Everything is all right,” said Billy gently. “Please don’t be afraid.”    Montana had been unconscious during her trip from Earth. The Tralfamadorians hadn’t talked to her, hadn’t shown themselves to her. The last thing she remembered was sunning herself by a swimming pool in Palm Springs, California. Montana was only twenty years old. Around her neck was a silver chain with a heart-shaped locket hanging from it—between her breasts. 
VoneKSF.txt	145	60.0	1969	Vonnegut, Kurt	Slaughterhouse Five	  The eight ridiculous Dresdeners ascertained that these hundred ridiculous creatures really were American fighting men fresh from the front. They smiled, and then they laughed. Their terror evaporated. There was nothing to be afraid of. Here were more crippled human beings, more fools like themselves. Here was light opera.    ***    So out of the gate of the railroad yard and into the streets of Dresden marched the light opera. Billy Pilgrim was the star. He led the parade. Thousands of people were on the sidewalks, going home from work. They were watery and putty-colored, having eaten mostly potatoes during the past two years. They had expected no blessings beyond the mildness of the day. Suddenly—here was fun.    Billy did not meet many of the eyes that found him so entertaining. He was enchanted by the architecture of the city. Merry amoretti wove garlands above windows. Roguish fauns and naked nymphs peeked down at Billy from festooned cornices. Stone monkeys frisked among scrolls and seashells and bamboo.    Billy, with his memories of the future, knew that the city would be smashed to smithereens and then burned—in about thirty more days. He knew, too, that most of the people watching him would soon be dead. So it goes.    And Billy worked his hands in his muff as he marched. His fingertips, working there in the hot darkness of the muff, wanted to know what the two lumps in the lining of the little impresario’s coat were. The fingertips got inside the lining. They palpated the lumps, the pea-shaped thing and the horseshoe-shaped thing. The parade had to halt by a busy corner. The traffic light was red. 
VoneKSF.txt	187	4.0	1969	Vonnegut, Kurt	Slaughterhouse Five	  Billy had a tremendous cavalry pistol in his belt. It was a relic of World War One. It had a ring in its butt. It was loaded with bullets the size of robins’ eggs. Billy had found it in the bedside table in a house. That was one of the things about the end of the war: Absolutely anybody who wanted a weapon could have one. They were lying all around. Billy had a saber, too. It was a Luftwaffe ceremonial saber. Its hilt was stamped with a screaming eagle. The eagle was carrying a swastika and looking down. Billy found it stuck into a telephone pole. He had pulled it out of the pole as the wagon went by.    ***    Now his snoozing became shallower as he heard a man and a woman speaking German in pitying tones. The speakers were commiserating with somebody lyrically. Before Billy opened his eyes, it seemed to him that the tones might have been those used by the friends of Jesus when they took His ruined body down from His cross. So it goes.    Billy opened his eyes. A middle-aged man and wife were crooning to the horses. They were noticing what the Americans had not noticed—that the horses’ mouths were bleeding, gashed by the bits, that the horses’ hooves were broken, so that every step meant agony, that the horses were insane with thirst. The Americans had treated their form of transportation as though it were no more sensitive than a six-cylinder Chevrolet. 
VoneKSF.txt	199	90.0	1969	Vonnegut, Kurt	Slaughterhouse Five	  He was gently expelled from the studio during a commercial. He went back to his hotel room, put a quarter into the Magic Fingers machine connected to his bed, and he went to sleep. He traveled in time back to Tralfamadore.    “Time-traveling again?” said Montana. It was artificial evening in the dome. She was breastfeeding their child.    “Hmm?” said Billy.    “You’ve been time-traveling again. I can always tell.”    “Um.”    “Where did you go this time? It wasn’t the war. I can tell that, too.”    “New York.”    “The Big Apple.”    “Hm?”    “That’s what they used to call New York.”    “Oh.”    “You see any plays or movies?”    “No—I walked around Times Square some, bought a book by Kilgore Trout.”    “Lucky you.” She did not share his enthusiasm for Kilgore Trout.    Billy mentioned casually that he had seen part of a blue movie she had made. Her response was no less casual. It was Tralfamadorian and guilt-free:    “Yes—” she said, “and I’ve heard about you in the war, about what a clown you were. And I’ve heard about the high-school teacher who was shot. He made a blue movie with a firing squad.” She moved the baby from one breast to the other, because the moment was so structured that she had to do so.    There was a silence. 
VoneKSF.txt	203	180.0	1969	Vonnegut, Kurt	Slaughterhouse Five	  ***    There were barricades on the main roads leading into the ruins. Germans were stopped there. They were not permitted to explore the moon.    ***    Prisoners of war from many lands came together that morning at such and such a place in Dresden. It had been decreed that here was where the digging for bodies was to begin. So the digging began.    Billy found himself paired as a digger with a Maori, who had been captured at Tobruk. The Maori was chocolate brown. He had whirlpools tattooed on his forehead and his cheeks. Billy and the Maori dug into the inert, unpromising gravel of the moon. The materials were loose, so there were constant little avalanches.    Many holes were dug at once. Nobody knew yet what there was to find. Most holes came to nothing—to pavement, or to boulders so huge they would not move. There was no machinery. Not even horses or mules or oxen could cross the moonscape.    And Billy and the Maori and others helping them with their particular hole came at last to a membrane of timbers laced over rocks which had wedged together to form an accidental dome. They made a hole in the membrane. There was darkness and space under there.    A German soldier with a flashlight went down into the darkness, was gone a long time. When he finally came back, he told a superior on the rim of the hole that there were dozens of bodies down there. They were sitting on benches. They were unmarked. 
VoneKSF.txt	204	120960.0	1969	Vonnegut, Kurt	Slaughterhouse Five	  So it goes.    The superior said that the opening in the membrane should be enlarged, and that a ladder should be put in the hole, so that the bodies could be carried out. Thus began the first corpse mine in Dresden.    ***    There were hundreds of corpse mines operating by and by. They didn’t smell bad at first, were wax museums. But then the bodies rotted and liquefied, and the stink was like roses and mustard gas.    So it goes.    The Maori Billy had worked with died of the dry heaves, after having been ordered to go down in that stink and work. He tore himself to pieces, throwing up and throwing up.    So it goes.    So a new technique was devised. Bodies weren’t brought up any more. They were cremated by soldiers with flamethrowers right where they were. The soldiers stood outside the shelters, simply sent the fire in.    Somewhere in there the poor old high school teacher, Edgar Derby, was caught with a teapot he had taken from the catacombs. He was arrested for plundering. He was tried and shot.    So it goes.    And somewhere in there was springtime. The corpse mines were closed down. The soldiers all left to fight the Russians. In the suburbs, the women and children dug rifle pits. Billy and the rest of his group were locked up in the stable in the suburbs. And then, one morning, they got up to discover that the door was unlocked. World War Two in Europe was over.    Billy and the rest wandered out onto the shady street. The trees were leafing out. There was nothing going on out there, no traffic of any kind. There was only one vehicle, an abandoned wagon drawn by two horses. The wagon was green and coffin-shaped.    Birds were talking.    One bird said to Billy Pilgrim, “Poo-tee-weet?”

Patience, dear Sir Martin, I'm not going to make any Comparisons: As to the Fright she has married, he must be some odd Mortal, a strange Animal to be sure. But her Ladyship alter'd her  Opinion before she had been half an Hour in Mr. Fool 's Company. The Moment he went out of the Room, she address'd his Lady with; by my Soul, Bella, I doat upon your Choice: Let me dye, my dear Creature, if I don't honour your Taste; the young Gentleman is immensely agreeable, and it must be vastly odd indeed, if you ar'nt vastly happy.

Unluckily the Lawyer interrupted him; by observing, that some People pretended to Coats of Arms, yet wanted Arms to their Coats. Flesh and Blood cou'd not bear this; he flung his Fist full upon Mr. Illicit 's Face; the astonish'd Lawyer started up like a Cock that's chained; and darting his Arms out strait, by way of keeping off Blows, he entangled his Fingers in Mr. Aprice 's Hair: Aprice rushing forward drove Mr. Illicit into a Corner; and there the Exciseman's Head, like a battering Ram, butted and rebutted against the Lawyer's Chin. The Welchman springing upon his Toes at every stroke, Mr. Illicit 's Teeth gnash'd lamentably, and the hinder Part of his Skull striking against the Wainscot, sounded dismal.  The Apothecary mounted himself by a Chair's Help on a Table, at the other End of the Room, with two Candles  in his Hands, to see, and show them fair Play. The Landlord stole away, to call the Exciseman's Wife; and the Landlady stood shrieking, clasping her Arms round a large China Bowl she had snatch'd up.  In the Corner, where the Heat of Battle roar'd, happen'd to be a Vessel, which for Delicacy-sake is named a Looking-glass. Whether the Combatants overset the Vessel, or the Vessel overthrew them, is yet undetermin'd.

Yet let me for the Honour of these Times observe; no, let us rather observe Sir Tasty and Junior, there they are, close together; the Baronet leaning his Elbow on a Dial, playing his Brilliant in the Sun-beams, and Junior with folded Arms, resting himself against the Summer-house.    Sir Tasty.  Look ye, Junior, among Friends, I'm fond of her; she's quite the Thing. I've seen something between you and her, but mum. You know my dear Friend I know the World; you have had her, I like her; and he who won't part from  his Woman to his Friend, has not a Drop of social Virtue about him.      Junior.  What makes you, Sir Tasty, imagine such a Thing is practicable?      Sir Tasty.  Come, come, don't be queer, don't hum; neither did you ever know a Woman that wou'dn't; that's all. Pon Honnor I'll disburse, here's a Bill for Fifty, bring her up to London: I know you're an honest Fellow. Hush, here's our Elders.      Enter Lady Dowager.  Mr. Junior, my Lady, has given me his Honour, he'll now and then kill an Hour this Winter with us in London.      Lady.  If Mr. Junior can find any thing there equal to his Merit.      Sir. Tasty.  You'll excuse me my Lady, I believe we shall have more Time to say fine Things when we meet next. Will I see is ready, so Dr. Jack Adieu, as the Ghost says in Hamlet. Farewell, remember me.

Pray my Lady don't cry, do pray take this Tea Cup-full, there my Lady, I'm sure 'twill do your Ladyship good: Crying spoils the Eyes; and such fine Eyes too as your Ladyship has: For all the Gentlemen that come to our House say, Mrs. Susan, your Lady has lovely Eyes.      Lady.  Lord, how the Wench runs on.      Susan.  Indeed, my Lady, Grief bringson Wrinkles,  the most fastest of any thing in the whole World; and such pure White and Red too as your Ladyship has, and all natural too, and that's more nor my Lady Grotto can say, for all she looks so Cherry-cheek'd.      Lady.  Oh, don't mention her Susan, but go for Mr. Rector, bring him to me immediately.      Susan.  Pray, my Lady, don't cry again, I'll go fetch the Parson pray my Lady, be compos'd I'll leave the Bottle with your Ladyship.    Exit Susan.  Now her Ladyship is left alone, her Eyes fast fix'd on the Bottle, like an Infant looking upon a Map. Her Spirits were frustrated; she wou'd have reflected about herself, Mr. Fool, Lady Grotto, and Junior; but a sudden Pain shot cross her Stomach; she was oblig'd to have Recourse to her Cordial. Her Imagination began to be abominably hurry'd; Crouds of complex'd Ideas disturb'd her; faltering disjointed Syllables fell from her Lips; inverted Shapes danc'd before her Sight; along the Bed she sidelong sunk; then heavy Sleep  Seiz'd on each dizzy Sense, and closed her coquer'd Eyes.

All was Distraction there: Mr. Fool had so endear'd himself to every Servant, by his Behaviour, that the whole House was in an Uproar, when it came to be known he went out with Pistols to  fight Junior. The Men went of their own Accord several Ways to seek their Master. But before this, Mrs. Susan had reach'd the Parsonage; where she found Mr. Rector deeply immers'd in electrical Experiments, endeavouring to discover an universal Nostrum.  For the Vicar, after the loss of Lady Fool, had given himself up entirely to the Study of the sublime Sciences; saying, like some other odd Philosophers, Women were unworthy a wise Man's Notice. As soon as Mrs. Susan saw him; she cry'd, Lord, Mr. Rector, you must come to my Lady immediately, she's all out of Sorts.    Mr. Rector.  If her Ladyship is out of Sorts, she must be electrified; that attenuates, that stimulates      Mrs. Susan.  It may be so, Sir, but our whole House is out of Sorts.      Mr. Rector.  Then the whole House must be electrified, as we fumigate against any epidemical Disease; or as Catholics in their Exorcisms sprinkle with holy Water.      Mrs. Susan.  I'm sure Water won't do her Ladyship any good, its too cold for her. So Mr.  Parson you must come and talk about your Learning to her, for she is but in a so and so Way, I can tell you.      Mr. Rector.

St. Austin, Seneca, Cardan, Boetius, Plato and Epictetus, have discriminately, my Lady, elucidated to us the Prevention of Grief; and what Tertullian tells us upon that Head is worthy Observation. Grief is in itself, as St. Chrysostom says, an Antithesis to Joy; therefore the Poets have defined Sorrow to be joyless, or abstracted from Mirth. Hence, by the Constriction, as well as Construction of the glandulous Valves, stimulated by the Diaphragma's Suspiration, the animal Spirits are jaculated into the lachrymal Ducts, which occasions Tears.      Lady.  No, Mr. Rector, it is Fear for my dear Husband's fighting a Duel, occasions my Tears.      Rector.  Pity it is, that Duelling should be the Men of Mode's Nostrum, when Electrifying is so much a safer Panacea. I am, my Lady, conscious of as much innate Bravery, as it is possible for any Man to  possess; but must I put my Life upon the impelled Velocity of a Bullet? Or suffer my Heart to be a horizontal Mark for the acute Point of a Rapier to perforate.      Lady.  Oh! Mr. Rector, how can you talk about killing, when that dear Creature, my Husband, may a be murdering this Moment.      Rector.  Madam, if his Honour should be destroyed, I shall be as much concerned for him, as a Philosopher ought to be the Man who kills him must be hanged, and your Ladyship must be electrified.

He had now need of all his Fortitude; without shutting down the Sash, softly on Tip-toe he stepped back again, took the Lanthorn, and hurried up Stairs into the back Garrets in Search for a Trapdoor or Casement, which opened upon  the Leads; very luckily he found one quickly; out he got, and after a Trial or two, found the Gutter would bear him; along sideling he crept, his Hands upon the Tiles, until he was stopped by a Ladder, which lay standing in his Way. This he conjectured might have some Communication with others lower; and after some Time feeling about (for he had put out his Light) he found a Bundle of scaffolding Cords, one End of which he made fast to the uppermost Ladder, and depending on that, and in Hopes of more Ladders, he began to descend; what with sliding and scrambling, he found himself at last safe landed in a narrow Lane; just then he heard the Minster Clock strike One; guided by that Sound, he walked towards the Church-yard, where he expected to find waiting for him a Friend, and a couple of fleet Horses.  For, unknown to the Goalor'd Lady, after he had fixed the Night and Hour in which he was to leave his Prison, he ordered one in whom he could confide, to be in the Minster-yard with a Brace of Geldings when the Clock struck Twelve, and stay till Junior came. Jack rightly judging it was a Place which at that Time of Night few People  would walk through, therefore his Groom and Cattle might secrete themselves there; and also Junior could find the Place more readily than any other.

I was allowed to be the greatest Genius that ever embellished an Evening's Conversation. I could take off Ryan, and the blind Man with his  Bladder and String. I could play upon my Coat's Skirt like a Bag-pipe, and make an old Woman's Face upon my Hand. I could make a Fiddle go like a German Flute, and grunt with my Mouth like an Organ; could do all the London Cries, and play a Solo upon a Broomstick; sound a Trumpet from the Corner of my Hat, and play a Voluntary by snapping my Fingers. I was the best Hand in England upon the Saltbox, and nobody sung the Welch Song like me; then I could growl like Quin, and squint like Parson Whitfield; and every Body allowed, at my own Table, I said as many good Things as any Man in England.  There we was one Thing very remarkable about me, which was, tho' I had an excessive Share of Spirits, they never hurried me into any particular Extravagancies. I detested Gaming; as to tossing up for the Reckoning now and then, or buying a few Lottery Tickets, just to make Presents with, those were Trifles not worth talking of, and what would not hurt any Body; but I was determined never to be taken in.

My Wife, after we had been in Town about two Months, began, tho' in the most tender Manner, to complain I absented myself too much from her, wish'd to have a little more of my Company, begged me, since I was so very entertaining Abroad, that I would indulge her now and then with my Conversation at Home. It went against me, I must confess, to deny her, but I had so many Invitations, and was so universally admired as a Companion, I could not help it; as to pleasing one's Wife, or the Pleasure a Man can receive from her Applause, it was not forcible enough for one of my Spirits, yet I made a secret Resolution, altho' I was too much from her at present, when I grew old, she should have me all to herself.  I have sometimes since thought, that a Man may have too great a Quantity of Spirits; for I could not stay at Home, and I was fearful too if I had, that the World would have given out, I had drowned my Faculties in the Cawdle-cup. The Ambition I had to be counted the cleverest Fellow in England, forced me to enter too much into the Spirit of Things. I sat up too late, drank too deep, used rather too much Ridicule, and slighted the finest Woman in England, and all often against my Inclination but he who has a Mind to gain a great Name, must sacrifice his private Connections to the Opinions of the Public.

The next Person who own'd me, was a Being, whom I cou'd, properly class under no  Character; he call'd himself a Jemmy, had a very fine Estate, was very lavish of it, in buying Nick-nacks, altering his Furniture, Harness, Post Charriots, and Taverns. Jaunting with me from Inn to Inn, leaving me no other Society than the Landlady, or the melancholy Amusement of looking thro' the Sashes, at the Carriages, and Travellers that came in and out of the Place where we happened to be. He was always boasting of the many fine Women he had enjoy'd; nor wou'd he let a Lady of Quality escape him; indeed he took Care where he told his Story. It was only to the Landlord's Family, who, like other Dependants, were obliged to be silent, and seem to believe whatever their Patron was pleased to tell them. For my Part, I believe he was Innocency itself; for in the six Months of our dawdling together, I was a Westal to him; he conversed with me as guiltless as my Brother. But with his all Vanity, and throwing away his Money, he never wou'd allow me Six-pence in my Pocket. This I cou'd not bear, and only staid with him till I cou'd fix upon a better Chapman.

However ridiculous this Scheme was, Miss Fool, whose whole Life had been but a Series of indiscreet Attachments, at once came into it; nay, she rejoiced to think she had an Opportunity to be reveng'd of her Brother, for his scolding her. On the Evening that Miss Demirep came to Town, they two took Post for Chester.  When Mr. Fool received a Card from Miss Demirep, he was reading the mad Epistle his Sister had left behind her. He inclos'd it in a Letter to Miss Demirep,  and in which, after he had related Miss Ninny 's Elopement, he told her, that Folly and Ingratitude had so much shock'd his Temper, he was not in a Condition fit for Society; that he was determin'd to retire for some Time at least from the World. And as he had several Affairs to settle in Jamaica, he wou'd go over to that Island immediately.  Miss Demirep, as soon as she had read the Contents, flew to Mr. Fool, and made use of every Argument to dissuade him from undertaking so dangerous a Voyage. But as it sometimes happens, when two Persons of different Religions dispute, the Argumentator, who designs to make the Proselyte, becomes himself a Convert. Thus Mr. Fool brought Miss Demirep over to his Opinion; she attended him to Bristol, and saw him take Shipping for Port-Royal.

The Editor, Transcriber, Historian, Journalists, &c. &c. begs Leave to assure the Public, that as Miss Demirep was capable of giving the most extraordinary Proofs of Affection to Mr. Fool, she did so; secretly contracting with the Captain for her own and Mem  Pinner 's Passage, and by a handsome Premium enjoin'd him Secresy.  The very next Day, when the Vessel was going briskly before the Wind, and Tom Fool was walking upon the Quarter Deck, the Captain's Boy came to tell him his Master wanted to speak to him in the great Cabbin: We'll leave to the Imagination of the Reader, what his Thoughts must be, when he saw coming forward to meet him, as he enter'd the Room-door, the noble-minded Miss Demirep.  N. B. There is now at the Publisher's all the original Letters, which Miss Demirep sent to Madam Vander Doit, concerning the extraordinary Adventures Mr. Fool met with Abroad.    1st. Being drove ashore on the Coast of Florida; how they were taken Prisoners by the Cannibals; the effects of Beauty upon Savages; how Mem Pinner was married to the King of that Part of the Country, and her Behaviour in high Life.  2dly. The manner in which Mr. Fool, and Miss Demirep, were entertain'd among the Savages; the deposing of Mem Pinner; their own Deliverance  and Voyage up the great River Amazon; the Difference of Behaviour between an Indian and an European, their Servants.  3dly. The History of their discovering, in the interior Parts of the Country, the real Kingdom of the Amazons; the Reception they met with among them.  4thly. A concise, but candid Account of the Government, Religion, Parties, Elections, Duels, Intrigues, Courts of Judicature, Universities, Theatres, Fashions, and Prize-fightings.  5thly. Mr. Fool and Miss Demirep 's safe Arrival at Jamaica, where he found his late Lady's Agent married to his Sister, Miss Ninny; Mr. Borlace was travelling at the same Time along the Continent, as a Merry-Andrew to a Mounteback.

greatexpectations.txt	0	5256000.0	1861	Dickens, Charles	Great Expectations	    GREAT EXPECTATIONS    [1867 Edition]    by Charles Dickens    Chapter I    My father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip, my  infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit  than Pip. So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip.    I give Pirrip as my father's family name, on the authority of his  tombstone and my sister,--Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith.  As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness  of either of them (for their days were long before the days of  photographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like were  unreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on  my father's, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man,  with curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription,  "Also Georgiana Wife of the Above," I drew a childish conclusion that  my mother was freckled and sickly. To five little stone lozenges, each  about a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside  their grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of  mine,--who gave up trying to get a living, exceedingly early in  that universal struggle,--I am indebted for a belief I religiously  entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands  in their trousers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state of  existence. 
greatexpectations.txt	1	120.0	1861	Dickens, Charles	Great Expectations	  Ours was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the river  wound, twenty miles of the sea. My first most vivid and broad impression  of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on a memorable  raw afternoon towards evening. At such a time I found out for certain  that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the churchyard; and  that Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and also Georgiana wife of the  above, were dead and buried; and that Alexander, Bartholomew, Abraham,  Tobias, and Roger, infant children of the aforesaid, were also dead  and buried; and that the dark flat wilderness beyond the churchyard,  intersected with dikes and mounds and gates, with scattered cattle  feeding on it, was the marshes; and that the low leaden line beyond  was the river; and that the distant savage lair from which the wind was  rushing was the sea; and that the small bundle of shivers growing afraid  of it all and beginning to cry, was Pip.    "Hold your noise!" cried a terrible voice, as a man started up from  among the graves at the side of the church porch. "Keep still, you  little devil, or I'll cut your throat!"    A fearful man, all in coarse gray, with a great iron on his leg. A man  with no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round his  head. A man who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, and  lamed by stones, and cut by flints, and stung by nettles, and torn by  briars; who limped, and shivered, and glared, and growled; and whose  teeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin. 
greatexpectations.txt	50	60.0	1861	Dickens, Charles	Great Expectations	  The soldiers were moving on in the direction of the old Battery, and we  were moving on a little way behind them, when, all of a sudden, we all  stopped. For there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain, a  long shout. It was repeated. It was at a distance towards the east, but  it was long and loud. Nay, there seemed to be two or more shouts raised  together,--if one might judge from a confusion in the sound.    To this effect the sergeant and the nearest men were speaking under  their breath, when Joe and I came up. After another moment's listening,  Joe (who was a good judge) agreed, and Mr. Wopsle (who was a bad judge)  agreed. The sergeant, a decisive man, ordered that the sound should not  be answered, but that the course should be changed, and that his men  should make towards it "at the double." So we slanted to the right  (where the East was), and Joe pounded away so wonderfully, that I had to  hold on tight to keep my seat.    It was a run indeed now, and what Joe called, in the only two words he  spoke all the time, "a Winder." Down banks and up banks, and over gates,  and splashing into dikes, and breaking among coarse rushes: no man cared  where he went. As we came nearer to the shouting, it became more and  more apparent that it was made by more than one voice. Sometimes, it  seemed to stop altogether, and then the soldiers stopped. When it broke  out again, the soldiers made for it at a greater rate than ever, and we  after them. After a while, we had so run it down, that we could hear one  voice calling "Murder!" and another voice, "Convicts! Runaways! Guard! 
greatexpectations.txt	52	2.5	1861	Dickens, Charles	Great Expectations	  The other convict was livid to look at, and, in addition to the old  bruised left side of his face, seemed to be bruised and torn all over.  He could not so much as get his breath to speak, until they were both  separately handcuffed, but leaned upon a soldier to keep himself from  falling.    "Take notice, guard,--he tried to murder me," were his first words.    "Tried to murder him?" said my convict, disdainfully. "Try, and not  do it? I took him, and giv' him up; that's what I done. I not only  prevented him getting off the marshes, but I dragged him here,--dragged  him this far on his way back. He's a gentleman, if you please, this  villain. Now, the Hulks has got its gentleman again, through me. Murder  him? Worth my while, too, to murder him, when I could do worse and drag  him back!"    The other one still gasped, "He tried--he tried-to--murder me.  Bear--bear witness."    "Lookee here!" said my convict to the sergeant. "Single-handed I got  clear of the prison-ship; I made a dash and I done it. I could ha' got  clear of these death-cold flats likewise--look at my leg: you won't find  much iron on it--if I hadn't made the discovery that he was here. Let  him go free? Let him profit by the means as I found out? Let him make a  tool of me afresh and again? Once more? No, no, no. If I had died at  the bottom there," and he made an emphatic swing at the ditch with his  manacled hands, "I'd have held to him with that grip, that you should  have been safe to find him in my hold." 
greatexpectations.txt	95	3.0	1861	Dickens, Charles	Great Expectations	  It was in this place, and at this moment, that a strange thing happened  to my fancy. I thought it a strange thing then, and I thought it a  stranger thing long afterwards. I turned my eyes--a little dimmed by  looking up at the frosty light--towards a great wooden beam in a low  nook of the building near me on my right hand, and I saw a figure  hanging there by the neck. A figure all in yellow white, with but  one shoe to the feet; and it hung so, that I could see that the faded  trimmings of the dress were like earthy paper, and that the face was  Miss Havisham's, with a movement going over the whole countenance as if  she were trying to call to me. In the terror of seeing the figure,  and in the terror of being certain that it had not been there a moment  before, I at first ran from it, and then ran towards it. And my terror  was greatest of all when I found no figure there.    Nothing less than the frosty light of the cheerful sky, the sight of  people passing beyond the bars of the court-yard gate, and the reviving  influence of the rest of the bread and meat and beer, would have brought  me round. Even with those aids, I might not have come to myself as soon  as I did, but that I saw Estella approaching with the keys, to let  me out. She would have some fair reason for looking down upon me, I  thought, if she saw me frightened; and she would have no fair reason. 
greatexpectations.txt	118	1.4994	1861	Dickens, Charles	Great Expectations	        Chapter XI    At the appointed time I returned to Miss Havisham's, and my hesitating  ring at the gate brought out Estella. She locked it after admitting  me, as she had done before, and again preceded me into the dark passage  where her candle stood. She took no notice of me until she had the  candle in her hand, when she looked over her shoulder, superciliously  saying, "You are to come this way to-day," and took me to quite another  part of the house.    The passage was a long one, and seemed to pervade the whole square  basement of the Manor House. We traversed but one side of the square,  however, and at the end of it she stopped, and put her candle down and  opened a door. Here, the daylight reappeared, and I found myself in  a small paved courtyard, the opposite side of which was formed by a  detached dwelling-house, that looked as if it had once belonged to the  manager or head clerk of the extinct brewery. There was a clock in the  outer wall of this house. Like the clock in Miss Havisham's room, and  like Miss Havisham's watch, it had stopped at twenty minutes to nine.    We went in at the door, which stood open, and into a gloomy room with a  low ceiling, on the ground-floor at the back. There was some company in  the room, and Estella said to me as she joined it, "You are to go and  stand there boy, till you are wanted." "There", being the window, I  crossed to it, and stood "there," in a very uncomfortable state of mind,  looking out. 
greatexpectations.txt	195	3.0	1861	Dickens, Charles	Great Expectations	  I was disconcerted, for I had broken away without quite seeing where  I was going to. It was not to be shuffled off now, however, and I  answered, "The beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham's, and she's more  beautiful than anybody ever was, and I admire her dreadfully, and I want  to be a gentleman on her account." Having made this lunatic confession,  I began to throw my torn-up grass into the river, as if I had some  thoughts of following it.    "Do you want to be a gentleman, to spite her or to gain her over?" Biddy  quietly asked me, after a pause.    "I don't know," I moodily answered.    "Because, if it is to spite her," Biddy pursued, "I should think--but  you know best--that might be better and more independently done by  caring nothing for her words. And if it is to gain her over, I should  think--but you know best--she was not worth gaining over."    Exactly what I myself had thought, many times. Exactly what was  perfectly manifest to me at the moment. But how could I, a poor dazed  village lad, avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and  wisest of men fall every day?    "It may be all quite true," said I to Biddy, "but I admire her  dreadfully." 
greatexpectations.txt	242	540.0	1861	Dickens, Charles	Great Expectations	  I was to leave our village at five in the morning, carrying my little  hand-portmanteau, and I had told Joe that I wished to walk away all  alone. I am afraid--sore afraid--that this purpose originated in my  sense of the contrast there would be between me and Joe, if we went to  the coach together. I had pretended with myself that there was nothing  of this taint in the arrangement; but when I went up to my little room  on this last night, I felt compelled to admit that it might be so, and  had an impulse upon me to go down again and entreat Joe to walk with me  in the morning. I did not.    All night there were coaches in my broken sleep, going to wrong places  instead of to London, and having in the traces, now dogs, now cats, now  pigs, now men,--never horses. Fantastic failures of journeys occupied  me until the day dawned and the birds were singing. Then, I got up and  partly dressed, and sat at the window to take a last look out, and in  taking it fell asleep.    Biddy was astir so early to get my breakfast, that, although I did not  sleep at the window an hour, I smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when  I started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the afternoon.  But long after that, and long after I had heard the clinking of the  teacups and was quite ready, I wanted the resolution to go downstairs. 
greatexpectations.txt	257	4.0	1861	Dickens, Charles	Great Expectations	Also, I was told what my allowance was to be,--it was a very liberal  one,--and had handed to me from one of my guardian's drawers, the cards  of certain tradesmen with whom I was to deal for all kinds of clothes,  and such other things as I could in reason want. "You will find your  credit good, Mr. Pip," said my guardian, whose flask of sherry smelt  like a whole caskful, as he hastily refreshed himself, "but I shall by  this means be able to check your bills, and to pull you up if I find you  outrunning the constable. Of course you'll go wrong somehow, but that's  no fault of mine."    After I had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment, I asked  Mr. Jaggers if I could send for a coach? He said it was not worth while,  I was so near my destination; Wemmick should walk round with me, if I  pleased.    I then found that Wemmick was the clerk in the next room. Another clerk  was rung down from upstairs to take his place while he was out, and I  accompanied him into the street, after shaking hands with my guardian.  We found a new set of people lingering outside, but Wemmick made a way  among them by saying coolly yet decisively, "I tell you it's no use; he  won't have a word to say to one of you;" and we soon got clear of them,  and went on side by side. 
greatexpectations.txt	319	1.0	1861	Dickens, Charles	Great Expectations	I asked him where we should  come to (for I had no idea where he lived), and I believe it was in his  general objection to make anything like an admission, that he replied,  "Come here, and I'll take you home with me." I embrace this opportunity  of remarking that he washed his clients off, as if he were a surgeon or  a dentist. He had a closet in his room, fitted up for the purpose, which  smelt of the scented soap like a perfumer's shop. It had an unusually  large jack-towel on a roller inside the door, and he would wash his  hands, and wipe them and dry them all over this towel, whenever he came  in from a police court or dismissed a client from his room. When I and  my friends repaired to him at six o'clock next day, he seemed to have  been engaged on a case of a darker complexion than usual, for we found  him with his head butted into this closet, not only washing his hands,  but laving his face and gargling his throat. And even when he had  done all that, and had gone all round the jack-towel, he took out his  penknife and scraped the case out of his nails before he put his coat  on. 
greatexpectations.txt	371	180.0	1861	Dickens, Charles	Great Expectations	  Of the manner and extent to which he took our trumps into custody, and  came out with mean little cards at the ends of hands, before which the  glory of our Kings and Queens was utterly abased, I say nothing; nor, of  the feeling that I had, respecting his looking upon us personally in the  light of three very obvious and poor riddles that he had found out long  ago. What I suffered from, was the incompatibility between his cold  presence and my feelings towards Estella. It was not that I knew I could  never bear to speak to him about her, that I knew I could never bear to  hear him creak his boots at her, that I knew I could never bear to see  him wash his hands of her; it was, that my admiration should be within  a foot or two of him,--it was, that my feelings should be in the same  place with him,--that, was the agonizing circumstance.    We played until nine o'clock, and then it was arranged that when Estella  came to London I should be forewarned of her coming and should meet her  at the coach; and then I took leave of her, and touched her and left  her. 
greatexpectations.txt	406	2.0	1861	Dickens, Charles	Great Expectations	  "You silly boy," said Estella, quite composedly, "how can you talk such  nonsense? Your friend Mr. Matthew, I believe, is superior to the rest of  his family?"    "Very superior indeed. He is nobody's enemy--"    "Don't add but his own," interposed Estella, "for I hate that class of  man. But he really is disinterested, and above small jealousy and spite,  I have heard?"    "I am sure I have every reason to say so."    "You have not every reason to say so of the rest of his people," said  Estella, nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once  grave and rallying, "for they beset Miss Havisham with reports and  insinuations to your disadvantage. They watch you, misrepresent you,  write letters about you (anonymous sometimes), and you are the torment  and the occupation of their lives. You can scarcely realize to yourself  the hatred those people feel for you."    "They do me no harm, I hope?"    Instead of answering, Estella burst out laughing. This was very singular  to me, and I looked at her in considerable perplexity. When she left  off--and she had not laughed languidly, but with real enjoyment--I said,  in my diffident way with her,--    "I hope I may suppose that you would not be amused if they did me any  harm." 
greatexpectations.txt	427	4.0	1861	Dickens, Charles	Great Expectations	We were all going to "follow," and were all in course of being tied up  separately (by Trabb) into ridiculous bundles.    "Which I meantersay, Pip," Joe whispered me, as we were being what Mr.  Trabb called "formed" in the parlor, two and two,--and it was dreadfully  like a preparation for some grim kind of dance; "which I meantersay,  sir, as I would in preference have carried her to the church myself,  along with three or four friendly ones wot come to it with willing harts  and arms, but it were considered wot the neighbors would look down on  such and would be of opinions as it were wanting in respect."    "Pocket-handkerchiefs out, all!" cried Mr. Trabb at this point, in a  depressed business-like voice. "Pocket-handkerchiefs out! We are ready!"    So we all put our pocket-handkerchiefs to our faces, as if our  noses were bleeding, and filed out two and two; Joe and I; Biddy and  Pumblechook; Mr. and Mrs. Hubble. The remains of my poor sister had been  brought round by the kitchen door, and, it being a point of Undertaking  ceremony that the six bearers must be stifled and blinded under a  horrible black velvet housing with a white border, the whole looked like  a blind monster with twelve human legs, shuffling and blundering along,  under the guidance of two keepers,--the postboy and his comrade. 
greatexpectations.txt	607	10.0	1861	Dickens, Charles	Great Expectations	  "Something that I would like done very much."    "What is it?"    I began explaining to her that secret history of the partnership. I had  not got far into it, when I judged from her looks that she was thinking  in a discursive way of me, rather than of what I said. It seemed to be  so; for, when I stopped speaking, many moments passed before she showed  that she was conscious of the fact.    "Do you break off," she asked then, with her former air of being afraid  of me, "because you hate me too much to bear to speak to me?"    "No, no," I answered, "how can you think so, Miss Havisham! I stopped  because I thought you were not following what I said."    "Perhaps I was not," she answered, putting a hand to her head. "Begin  again, and let me look at something else. Stay! Now tell me."    She set her hand upon her stick in the resolute way that sometimes was  habitual to her, and looked at the fire with a strong expression of  forcing herself to attend. I went on with my explanation, and told her  how I had hoped to complete the transaction out of my means, but how  in this I was disappointed. That part of the subject (I reminded her)  involved matters which could form no part of my explanation, for they  were the weighty secrets of another. 
greatexpectations.txt	748	2.0	1861	Dickens, Charles	Great Expectations	  "I have very often hoped and intended to come back, but have been  prevented by many circumstances. Poor, poor old place!"    The silvery mist was touched with the first rays of the moonlight, and  the same rays touched the tears that dropped from her eyes. Not knowing  that I saw them, and setting herself to get the better of them, she said  quietly,--    "Were you wondering, as you walked along, how it came to be left in this  condition?"    "Yes, Estella."    "The ground belongs to me. It is the only possession I have not  relinquished. Everything else has gone from me, little by little, but I  have kept this. It was the subject of the only determined resistance I  made in all the wretched years."    "Is it to be built on?"    "At last, it is. I came here to take leave of it before its change. And  you," she said, in a voice of touching interest to a wanderer,--"you  live abroad still?"    "Still."    "And do well, I am sure?"    "I work pretty hard for a sufficient living, and therefore--yes, I do  well."    "I have often thought of you," said Estella.    "Have you?"    "Of late, very often. There was a long hard time when I kept far from me  the remembrance of what I had thrown away when I was quite ignorant  of its worth. But since my duty has not been incompatible with the  admission of that remembrance, I have given it a place in my heart." 
greatexpectations.txt	749	5.0	1861	Dickens, Charles	Great Expectations	  "You have always held your place in my heart," I answered.    And we were silent again until she spoke.    "I little thought," said Estella, "that I should take leave of you in  taking leave of this spot. I am very glad to do so."    "Glad to part again, Estella? To me, parting is a painful thing. To me,  the remembrance of our last parting has been ever mournful and painful."    "But you said to me," returned Estella, very earnestly, "'God bless you,  God forgive you!' And if you could say that to me then, you will not  hesitate to say that to me now,--now, when suffering has been stronger  than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what your heart  used to be. I have been bent and broken, but--I hope--into a better  shape. Be as considerate and good to me as you were, and tell me we are  friends."    "We are friends," said I, rising and bending over her, as she rose from  the bench.    "And will continue friends apart," said Estella.    I took her hand in mine, and we went out of the ruined place; and, as  the morning mists had risen long ago when I first left the forge, so the  evening mists were rising now, and in all the broad expanse of tranquil  light they showed to me, I saw no shadow of another parting from her.       
HuxlAB.txt	0	5.0	1932	Huxley, Aldous	Brave New World	1          A squat grey building of only thirty-four stories. Over the main entrance the words, CENTRAL LONDON HATCHERY AND CONDITIONING CENTRE, and, in a shield, the World State’s motto, COMMUNITY, IDENTITY, STABILITY.    The enormous room on the ground floor faced towards the north. Cold for all the summer beyond the panes, for all the tropical heat of the room itself, a harsh thin light glared through the windows, hungrily seeking some draped lay figure, some pallid shape of academic goose-flesh, but finding only the glass and nickel and bleakly shining porcelain of a laboratory. Wintriness responded to wintriness. The overalls of the workers were white, their hands gloved with a pale corpse-coloured rubber. The light was frozen, dead, a ghost. Only from the yellow barrels of the microscopes did it borrow a certain rich and living substance, lying along the polished tubes like butter, streak after luscious streak in long recession down the work tables.    “And this,” said the Director opening the door, “is the Fertilizing Room.”    Bent over their instruments, three hundred Fertilizers were plunged, as the Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning entered the room, in the scarcely breathing silence, the absent-minded, soliloquizing hum or whistle, of absorbed concentration. A troop of newly arrived students, very young, pink and callow, followed nervously, rather abjectly, at the Director’s heels. Each of them carried a notebook, in which, whenever the great man spoke, he desperately scribbled. Straight from the horse’s mouth. It was a rare privilege. The D.H.C. for Central London always made a point of personally conducting his new students round the various departments. 
HuxlAB.txt	1	3.0	1932	Huxley, Aldous	Brave New World	  “Just to give you a general idea,” he would explain to them. For of course some sort of general idea they must have, if they were to do their work intelligently—though as little of one, if they were to be good and happy members of society, as possible. For particulars, as every one knows, make for virtue and happiness; generalities are intellectually necessary evils. Not philosophers but fretsawyers and stamp collectors compose the backbone of society.    “To-morrow,” he would add, smiling at them with a slightly menacing geniality, “you’ll be settling down to serious work. You won’t have time for generalities. Meanwhile . . .”    Meanwhile, it was a privilege. Straight from the horse’s mouth into the notebook. The boys scribbled like mad.    Tall and rather thin but upright, the Director advanced into the room. He had a long chin and big rather prominent teeth, just covered, when he was not talking, by his full, floridly curved lips. Old, young? Thirty? Fifty? Fifty-five? It was hard to say. And anyhow the question didn’t arise; in this year of stability, A.F. 632, it didn’t occur to you to ask it.    “I shall begin at the beginning,” said the D.H.C. and the more zealous students recorded his intention in their notebooks: Begin at the beginning. “These,” he waved his hand, “are the incubators.” And opening an insulated door he showed them racks upon racks of numbered test-tubes. “The week’s supply of ova. Kept,” he explained, “at blood heat; whereas the male gametes,” and here he opened another door, “they have to be kept at thirty-five instead of thirty-seven. Full blood heat sterilizes.” Rams wrapped in theremogene beget no lambs. 
HuxlAB.txt	44	2.0	1932	Huxley, Aldous	Brave New World	    “Or the Caste System. Constantly proposed, constantly rejected. There was something called democracy. As though men were more than physico-chemically equal.”      “Well, all I can say is that I’m going to accept his invitation.”      Bernard hated them, hated them. But they were two, they were large, they were strong.      “Then the Nine Years’ War began in A.F. 141.”      “Not even if it were true about the alcohol in his blood-surrogate.”      “Phosgene, chloropicrin, ethyl iodoacetate, diphenylcyanarsine, trichlormethyl, chloroformate, dichlorethyl sulphide. Not to mention hydrocyanic acid.”      “Which I simply don’t believe,” Lenina concluded.      “The noise of fourteen thousand aeroplanes advancing in open order. But in the Kurfurstendamm and the Eighth Arrondissement, the explosion of the anthrax bombs is hardly louder than the popping of a paper bag.”      “Because I do want to see a Savage Reservation.”      Ch8C6H2(NO2)8 + Hg(CNO)2 = well, what? An enormous hole in the ground, a pile of masonry, some bits of flesh and mucus, a foot, with the boot still on it, flying through the air and landing, flop, in the middle of the geraniums—the scarlet ones; such a splendid show that summer!      “You’re hopeless, Lenina, I give you up.”      “The Russian technique for infecting water supplies was particularly ingenious.”      Back turned to back, Fanny and Lenina continued their changing in silence. 
HuxlAB.txt	61	3.0	1932	Huxley, Aldous	Brave New World	That which had made Helmholtz so uncomfortably aware of being himself and all alone was too much ability. What the two men shared was the knowledge that they were individuals. But whereas the physically defective Bernard had suffered all his life from the consciousness of being separate, it was only quite recently that, grown aware of his mental excess, Helmholtz Watson had also become aware of his difference from the people who surrounded him. This Escalator-Squash champion, this indefatigable lover (it was said that he had had six hundred and forty different girls in under four years), this admirable committee man and best mixer had realized quite suddenly that sport, women, communal activities were only, so far as he was concerned, second bests. Really, and at the bottom, he was interested in something else. But in what? In what? That was the problem which Bernard had come to discuss with him—or rather, since it was always Helmholtz who did all the talking, to listen to his friend discussing, yet once more.    Three charming girls from the Bureaux of Propaganda by Synthetic Voice waylaid him as he stepped out of the lift.    “Oh, Helmholtz, darling, do come and have a picnic supper with us on Exmoor.” They clung round him imploringly.    He shook his head, he pushed his way through them. “No, no.”    “We’re not inviting any other man.”    But Helmholtz remained unshaken even by this delightful promise. “No,” he repeated, “I’m busy.” And he held resolutely on his course. The girls trailed after him. It was not till he had actually climbed into Bernard’s plane and slammed the door that they gave up pursuit. Not without reproaches. 
HuxlAB.txt	107	20.0	1932	Huxley, Aldous	Brave New World	  But a little later it was reminding her a good deal less of that innocuous function. For suddenly there had swarmed up from those round chambers underground a ghastly troop of monsters. Hideously masked or painted out of all semblance of humanity, they had tramped out a strange limping dance round the square; round and again round, singing as they went, round and round—each time a little faster; and the drums had changed and quickened their rhythm, so that it became like the pulsing of fever in the ears; and the crowd had begun to sing with the dancers, louder and louder; and first one woman had shrieked, and then another and another, as though they were being killed; and then suddenly the leader of the dancers broke out of the line, ran to a big wooden chest which was standing at one end of the square, raised the lid and pulled out a pair of black snakes. A great yell went up from the crowd, and all the other dancers ran towards him with out-stretched hands. He tossed the snakes to the first-comers, then dipped back into the chest for more. More and more, black snakes and brown and mottled—he flung them out. And then the dance began again on a different rhythm. Round and round they went with their snakes, snakily, with a soft undulating movement at the knees and hips. Round and round.
HuxlAB.txt	119	2.0	1932	Huxley, Aldous	Brave New World	In those other words he did not understand so well, she said to the man, “Not with John here.” The man looked at him, then again at Linda, and said a few words in a soft voice. Linda said, “No.” But the man bent over the bed towards him and his face was huge, terrible; the black ropes of hair touched the blanket. “No,” Linda said again, and he felt her hand squeezing him more tightly. “No, no!” But the man took hold of one of his arms, and it hurt. He screamed. The man put up his other hand and lifted him up. Linda was still holding him, still saying, “No, no.” The man said something short and angry, and suddenly her hands were gone. “Linda, Linda.” He kicked and wriggled; but the man carried him across to the door, opened it, put him down on the floor in the middle of the other room, and went away, shutting the door behind him. He got up, he ran to the door. Standing on tiptoe he could just reach the big wooden latch. He lifted it and pushed; but the door wouldn’t open. “Linda,” he shouted. She didn’t answer. 
HuxlAB.txt	142	5.0	1932	Huxley, Aldous	Brave New World	  Half an hour later it occurred to him to look through the window. The first thing he saw was a green suit-case, with the initials L.C. painted on the lid. Joy flared up like fire within him. He picked up a stone. The smashed glass tinkled on the floor. A moment later he was inside the room. He opened the green suit-case; and all at once he was breathing Lenina’s perfume, filling his lungs with her essential being. His heart beat wildly; for a moment he was almost faint. Then, bending over the precious box, he touched, he lifted into the light, he examined. The zippers on Lenina’s spare pair of viscose velveteen shorts were at first a puzzle, then solved, a delight. Zip, and then zip; zip, and then zip; he was enchanted. Her green slippers were the most beautiful things he had ever seen. He unfolded a pair of zippicamiknicks, blushed, put them hastily away again; but kissed a perfumed acetate handkerchief and wound a scarf round his neck. Opening a box, he spilt a cloud of scented powder. His hands were floury with the stuff. He wiped them on his chest, on his shoulders, on his bare arms. Delicious perfume! He shut his eyes; he rubbed his cheek against his own powdered arm. Touch of smooth skin against his face, scent in his nostrils of musky dust—her real presence. “Lenina,” he whispered. “Lenina!”    A noise made him start, made him guiltily turn. He crammed up his thieveries into the suit-case and shut the lid; then listened again, looked. Not a sign of life, not a sound. And yet he had certainly heard something—something like a sigh, something like the creak of a board. He tiptoed to the door and, cautiously opening it, found himself looking on to a broad landing. On the opposite side of the landing was another door, ajar. He stepped out, pushed, peeped. 
HuxlAB.txt	143	3.0	1932	Huxley, Aldous	Brave New World	  There, on a low bed, the sheet flung back, dressed in a pair of pink one-piece zippyjamas, lay Lenina, fast asleep and so beautiful in the midst of her curls, so touchingly childish with her pink toes and her grave sleeping face, so trustful in the helplessness of her limp hands and melted limbs, that the tears came to his eyes.    With an infinity of quite unnecessary precautions—for nothing short of a pistol short could have called Lenina back from her soma-holiday before the appointed time—he entered the room, he knelt on the floor beside the bed. He gazed, he clasped his hands, his lips moved. “Her eyes,” he murmured,    “Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice;    Handlest in thy discourse O! that her hand,    In whose comparison all whites are ink    Writing their own reproach; to whose soft seizure    The cygnet’s down is harsh . . .”    A fly buzzed round her; he waved it away. “Flies,” he remembered,    “On the white wonder of dear Juliet’s hand, may seize    And steal immortal blessing from her lips,    Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,    Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin.”    Very slowly, with the hesitating gesture of one who reaches forward to stroke a shy and possibly rather dangerous bird, he put out his hand. It hung there trembling, within an inch of those limp fingers, on the verge of contact. Did he dare? Dare to profane with his unworthiest hand that . . . No, he didn’t. The bird was too dangerous. His hand dropped back. How beautiful she was! How beautiful! 
HuxlAB.txt	149	3.0	1932	Huxley, Aldous	Brave New World	  “What’s the meaning,” began the Director, “of this monstrous . . .”    “Tomakin!” She ran forward, her blanket trailing behind her, threw her arms round his neck, hid her face on his chest.    A howl of laughter went up irrepressibly.    “. . . this monstrous practical joke,” the Director shouted.    Red in the face, he tried to disengage himself from her embrace. Desperately she clung. “But I’m Linda, I’m Linda.” The laughter drowned her voice. “You made me have a baby,” she screamed above the uproar. There was a sudden and appalling hush; eyes floated uncomfortably, not knowing where to look. The Director went suddenly pale, stopped struggling and stood, his hands on her wrists, staring down at her, horrified. “Yes, a baby—and I was its mother.” She flung the obscenity like a challenge into the outraged silence; then, suddenly breaking away from him, ashamed, ashamed, covered her face with her hands, sobbing. “It wasn’t my fault, Tomakin. Because I always did my drill, didn’t I? Didn’t I? Always . . . I don’t know how . . . If you knew how awful, Tomakin . . . But he was a comfort to me, all the same.” Turning towards the door, “John!” she called.
HuxlAB.txt	158	60.0	1932	Huxley, Aldous	Brave New World	  “Each process,” explained the Human Element Manager, “is carried out, so far as possible, by a single Bokanovsky Group.”    And, in effect, eighty-three almost noseless black brachycephalic Deltas were cold-pressing. The fifty-six four-spindle chucking and turning machines were being manipulated by fifty-six aquiline and ginger Gammas. One hundred and seven heat-conditioned Epsilon Senegalese were working in the foundry. Thirty-three Delta females, long-headed, sandy, with narrow pelvises, and all within 20 millimetres of 1 metre 69 centimetres tall, were cutting screws. In the assembling room, the dynamos were being put together by two sets of Gamma-Plus dwarfs. The two low work-tables faced one another; between them crawled the conveyor with its load of separate parts; forty-seven blonde heads were confronted by forty-seven brown ones. Forty-seven snubs by forty-seven hooks; forty-seven receding by forty-seven prognathous chins. The completed mechanisms were inspected by eighteen identical curly auburn girls in Gamma green, packed in crates by thirty-four short-legged, left-handed male Delta-Minuses, and loaded into the waiting trucks and lorries by sixty-three blue-eyed, flaxen and freckled Epsilon Semi-Morons.    “O brave new world . . .” By some malice of his memory the Savage found himself repeating Miranda’s words. “O brave new world that has such people in it.”    “And I assure you,” the Human Element Manager concluded, as they left the factory, “we hardly ever have any trouble with our workers. We always find . . .”    But the Savage had suddenly broken away from his companions and was violently retching, behind a clump of laurels, as though the solid earth had been a helicopter in an air pocket. 
HuxlAB.txt	188	2.0	1932	Huxley, Aldous	Brave New World	  “Not glad?” The Savage looked at her reproachfully; then suddenly fell on his knees before her and, taking Lenina’s hand, reverently kissed it. “Not glad? Oh, if you only knew,” he whispered and, venturing to raise his eyes to her face, “Admired Lenina,” he went on, “indeed the top of admiration, worth what’s dearest in the world.” She smiled at him with a luscious tenderness. “Oh, you so perfect” (she was leaning towards him with parted lips), “so perfect and so peerless are created” (nearer and nearer) “of every creature’s best.” Still nearer. The Savage suddenly scrambled to his feet. “That’s why,” he said speaking with averted face, “I wanted to do something first . . . I mean, to show I was worthy of you. Not that I could ever really be that. But at any rate to show I wasn’t absolutely un-worthy. I wanted to do something.”    “Why should you think it necessary . . .” Lenina began, but left the sentence unfinished. There was a note of irritation in her voice. When one has leant forward, nearer and nearer, with parted lips—only to find oneself, quite suddenly, as a clumsy oaf scrambles to his feet, leaning towards nothing at all—well, there is a reason, even with half a gramme of soma circulating in one’s blood-stream, a genuine reason for annoyance.    “At Malpais,” the Savage was incoherently mumbling, “you had to bring her the skin of a mountain lion—I mean, when you wanted to marry some one. Or else a wolf.”    “There aren’t any lions in England,” Lenina almost snapped. 
HuxlAB.txt	192	3.0	1932	Huxley, Aldous	Brave New World	  “Lenina!” he repeated apprehensively.    She put her hand to her neck and gave a long vertical pull; her white sailor’s blouse was ripped to the hem; suspicion condensed into a too, too solid certainty. “Lenina, what are you doing?”    Zip, zip! Her answer was wordless. She stepped out of her bell-bottomed trousers. Her zippicamiknicks were a pale shell pink. The Arch-Community-Songster’s golden T dangled at her breast.    “For those milk paps that through the window bars bore at men’s eyes. . . .” The singing, thundering, magical words made her seem doubly dangerous, doubly alluring. Soft, soft, but how piercing! boring and drilling into reason, tunnelling through resolution. “The strongest oaths are straw to the fire i’ the blood. Be more abstemious, or else . . .”    Zip! The rounded pinkness fell apart like a neatly divided apple. A wriggle of the arms, a lifting first of the right foot, then the left: the zippicamiknicks were lying lifeless and as though deflated on the floor.    Still wearing her shoes and socks, and her rakishly tilted round white cap, she advanced towards him. “Darling. Darling! If only you’d said so before!” She held out her arms.    But instead of also saying “Darling!” and holding out his arms, the Savage retreated in terror, flapping his hands at her as though he were trying to scare away some intruding and dangerous animal. Four backwards steps, and he was brought to bay against the wall. 
HuxlAB.txt	200	2.0	1932	Huxley, Aldous	Brave New World	  A, B, C, vitamin D:    The fat’s in the liver, the cod’s in the sea.    He felt the hot tears welling up behind his eyelids as he recalled the words and Linda’s voice as she repeated them. And then the reading lessons: The tot is in the pot, the cat is on the mat; and the Elementary Instructions for Beta Workers in the Embryo Store. And long evenings by the fire or, in summertime, on the roof of the little house, when she told him those stories about the Other Place, outside the Reservation: that beautiful, beautiful Other Place, whose memory, as of a heaven, a paradise of goodness and loveliness, he still kept whole and intact, undefiled by contact with the reality of this real London, these actual civilized men and women.    A sudden noise of shrill voices made him open his eyes and, after hastily brushing away the tears, look round. What seemed an interminable stream of identical eight-year-old male twins was pouring into the room. Twin after twin, twin after twin, they came—a nightmare. Their faces, their repeated face—for there was only one between the lot of them—puggishly stared, all nostrils and pale goggling eyes. Their uniform was khaki. All their mouths hung open. Squealing and chattering they entered. In a moment, it seemed, the ward was maggoty with them. They swarmed between the beds, clambered over, crawled under, peeped into the television boxes, made faces at the patients. 
HuxlAB.txt	250	360.0	1932	Huxley, Aldous	Brave New World	  He went indoors, opened the box of mustard, and put some water to boil on the fire.    Half an hour later, three Delta-Minus land-workers from one of the Puttenham Bokanovsky Groups happened to be driving to Elstead and, at the top of the hill, were astonished to see a young man standing outside the abandoned lighthouse stripped to the waist and hitting himself with a whip of knotted cords. His back was horizontally streaked with crimson, and from weal to weal ran thin trickles of blood. The driver of the lorry pulled up at the side of the road and, with his two companions, stared open-mouthed at the extraordinary spectacle. One, two three—they counted the strokes. After the eighth, the young man interrupted his self-punishment to run to the wood’s edge and there be violently sick. When he had finished, he picked up the whip and began hitting himself again. Nine, ten, eleven, twelve . . .    “Ford!” whispered the driver. And his twins were of the same opinion.    “Fordey!” they said.    Three days later, like turkey buzzards settling on a corpse, the reporters came.    Dried and hardened over a slow fire of green wood, the bow was ready. The Savage was busy on his arrows. Thirty hazel sticks had been whittled and dried, tipped with sharp nails, carefully nocked. He had made a raid one night on the Puttenham poultry farm, and now had feathers enough to equip a whole armoury. It was at work upon the feathering of his shafts that the first of the reporters found him. Noiseless on his pneumatic shoes, the man came up behind him. 
HuxlAB.txt	260	10.0	1932	Huxley, Aldous	Brave New World	  “We—want—the whip! We—want—the whip!”    The young woman pressed both hands to her left side, and on that peach-bright, doll-beautiful face of hers appeared a strangely incongruous expression of yearning distress. Her blue eyes seemed to grow larger, brighter; and suddenly two tears rolled down her cheeks. Inaudibly, she spoke again; then, with a quick, impassioned gesture stretched out her arms towards the Savage, stepped forward.    “We—want—the whip! We—want . . .”    And all of a sudden they had what they wanted.    “Strumpet!” The Savage had rushed at her like a madman. “Fitchew!” Like a madman, he was slashing at her with his whip of small cords.    Terrified, she had turned to flee, had tripped and fallen in the heather. “Henry, Henry!” she shouted. But her ruddy-faced companion had bolted out of harm’s way behind the helicopter.    With a whoop of delighted excitement the line broke; there was a convergent stampede towards that magnetic centre of attraction. Pain was a fascinating horror.    “Fry, lechery, fry!” Frenzied, the Savage slashed again.    Hungrily they gathered round, pushing and scrambling like swine about the trough.    “Oh, the flesh!” The Savage ground his teeth. This time it was on his shoulders that the whip descended. “Kill it, kill it!”    Drawn by the fascination of the horror of pain and, from within, impelled by that habit of cooperation, that desire for unanimity and atonement, which their conditioning had so ineradicably implanted in them, they began to mime the frenzy of his gestures, striking at one another as the Savage struck at his own rebellious flesh, or at that plump incarnation of turpitude writhing in the heather at his feet. 
HuxlAB.txt	261	1080.0	1932	Huxley, Aldous	Brave New World	  “Kill it, kill it, kill it . . .” The Savage went on shouting.    Then suddenly somebody started singing “Orgy-porgy” and, in a moment, they had all caught up the refrain and, singing, had begun to dance. Orgy-porgy, round and round and round, beating one another in six-eight time. Orgy-porgy . . .    It was after midnight when the last of the helicopters took its flight. Stupefied by soma, and exhausted by a long-drawn frenzy of sensuality, the Savage lay sleeping in the heather. The sun was already high when he awoke. He lay for a moment, blinking in owlish incomprehension at the light; then suddenly remembered—everything.    “Oh, my God, my God!” He covered his eyes with his hand.      That evening the swarm of helicopters that came buzzing across the Hog’s Back was a dark cloud ten kilometres long. The description of last night’s orgy of atonement had been in all the papers.    “Savage!” called the first arrivals, as they alighted from their machine. “Mr. Savage!”    There was no answer.    The door of the lighthouse was ajar. They pushed it open and walked into a shuttered twilight. Through an archway on the further side of the room they could see the bottom of the staircase that led up to the higher floors. Just under the crown of the arch dangled a pair of feet.    “Mr. Savage!”    Slowly, very slowly, like two unhurried compass needles, the feet turned towards the right; north, north-east, east, south-east, south, south-south-west; then paused, and, after a few seconds, turned as unhurriedly back towards the left. South-south-west, south, south-east, east. . . .           
NinASHL.txt	0	3.0	1954	Nin, Anais	A spy in the house of love	THE LIE DETECTOR WAS ASLEEP when he heard the telephone ringing.    At first he believed it was the clock ordering him to rise, but then he awakened completely and remembered his profession.    The voice he heard was rusty, as if disguised. He could not distinguish what altered it: alcohol, drugs, anxiety or fear.    It was a woman's voice; but it could have been an adolescent imitating a woman, or a woman imitating an adolescent.    "What is it?" he asked. "Hello. Hello. Hello."    "I had to talk to someone; I can't sleep. I had to call someone."    "You have something to confess..."    "To confess?" echoed the voice incredulously; this time, the ascending tonalities unmistakably feminine.    "Don't you know who I am?"    "No, I just dialed blindly. I've done this before. It is good to hear a voice in the middle of the night, that's all."    "Why a stranger? You could call a friend."    "A stranger doesn't ask questions."    "But it's my profession to ask questions."    "Who are you?"    "A lie detector."    There was a long silence after his words. The lie detector expected her to hang up. But he heard her cough through the telephone.    "Are you there?"    "Yes."    "I thought you would hang up."    There was laughter through the telephone, a lax, spangled, spiraling laughter. "But you don't practice your profession over the telephone!" 
NinASHL.txt	1	2.0	1954	Nin, Anais	A spy in the house of love	  "It's true. Yet you wouldn't have called me if you were innocent. Guilt is the one burden human beings can't bear alone. As soon as a crime is committed, there is a telephone call, or a confession to strangers."    "There was no crime."    "There is only one relief: to confess, to be caught, tried, punished. That's the ideal of every criminal. But it's not quite so simple. Only half of the self wants to atone, to be freed of the torments of guilt. The other half of man wants to continue to be free. So only half of the self surrenders, calling out 'catch me,' while the other half creates obstacles, difficulties; seeks to escape. It's a flirtation with justice. If justice is nimble, it will follow the clue with the criminal's help. If not, the criminal will take care of his own atonement."    "Is that worse?"    "I think so. I think we are more severe judges of our own acts than professional judges. We judge our thoughts, our intents, our secret curses, our secret hates, not only our acts."    She hung up.    The lie detector called up the operator, gave orders to have the call traced. It came from a bar. Half an hour later, he was sitting there.    He did not allow his eyes to roam or examine. He wanted his ears alone to be attentive, that he might recognize the voice.    When she ordered a drink, he lifted his eyes from his newspaper. 
NinASHL.txt	22	60.0	1954	Nin, Anais	A spy in the house of love	  At night too she puzzled over the mystery of her desperate need of kindness. As other girls prayed for handsomeness in a lover, or for wealth, or for power, or for poetry, she had prayed fervently: let him be kind.    Why should she have had such a need of kindness? Was she a cripple? What if instead she had married a man of violence or a man of cruelty?    At the mere word "cruelty" her heart started to beat feverishly. The enormity of the dangers she had averted was so great she did not even dare picture them. She had desired and obtained kindness. And now that she had found it she risked its loss every day, every hour, on other quests!    Alan slept so peacefully. Even in sleep he maintained a serenity of gesture. The firm design of his nose, mouth and chin, the angular lines of the body, all sculptured from some material of rectitude that would not slacken. In moments of desire even, he did not have the wildness of the eyes, disordered hair of others. He would never grow almost delirious with pleasure or utter sounds not quite human, from the jungle of man's earlier animalism. 
NinASHL.txt	43	10.0	1954	Nin, Anais	A spy in the house of love	  The ripples of her walk started from the pelvis and hips, a strong undulation like waves of muscles flowing from the feet to the knees, to the hips and back to the waist. She walked with her entire body as if to gain momentum for an event in which her entire body would participate. On her face there was no longer any bewilderment, but a vehemence which caused people to stop and glance at her face as if they had been touched by a magnet.    The evening lights were being turned on, and at this hour Sabina felt like the city, as if all the lights were turned on at once causing a vast illumination. There were lights on her hair, in her eyes, on her nails, on the ripples of her purple dress now turning black.    When she finally reached the apartment, she realized she still did not know whether he lived alone.    He guided her into a room which looked like him and had been arranged for him alone. His skiing trophies hung on the walls: on a Viennese curtain of damask hung a whole army of tin soldiers in army formation. On the piano lay stacks of music in disorder, and in the center of the room, under an umbrella hung open from the ceiling, a partly constructed telescope.    "I want to see the stars with my own handmade telescope. I'm now polishing the glass. It takes a long, long time and a great deal of patience." 
NinASHL.txt	56	2.0	1954	Nin, Anais	A spy in the house of love	  The music stopped, he came to her table, sat down and gave her a smile mixed with a contraction of pain.    "I know," he said. "I know..."    "You know?"    "I know, but it cannot be," he said very gently. And then suddenly the anger overflowed: "For me, it's everything or nothing. I've known this before...a woman like you. Desire. It's desire, but not for me. You don't know me. It's for my race, it's for a sensual power we have."    He reached for her wrists and spoke close to her face: "It destroys me. Everywhere desire, and in the ultimate giving, withdrawal. Because I am African. What do you know of me? I sing and drum and you desire me. But I'm not an entertainer. I'm a mathematician, a composer, a writer." He looked at her severely, the fullness of his mouth difficult to compress in anger but his eyes lashing: "You wouldn't come to Ile Joyeuse and be my wife and bear me black children and wait patiently upon my Negro grandmother!"    Sabina answered him with equal vehemence, throwing her hair away from her face, and lowering the pitch of her voice until it sounded like an insult: "I'll tell you one thing: if it were only what you say, I've had that, and it didn't hold me, it was not enough. It was magnificent, but it didn't hold me. You're destroying everything, with your bitterness. You're angry, you've been hurt..." 
NinASHL.txt	63	0.4998	1954	Nin, Anais	A spy in the house of love	      Once in an ancient city in South America, Sabina had seen streets which had been ravaged by an earthquake. Nothing was left but façades, as in Chirico paintings; the façades of granite had remained with doors and windows half unhinged, opening unexpectedly, not upon a household nestled around a hearth, but whole families camping under the sky, protected from strangers only by one wall and door, but otherwise completely free of walls or roofs from the other three sides.    She realized that it was this illimitable space she had expected to find in every lover's room, the sea, the mountains visible all around, the world shut off on one side. A hearth without roof or walls, growing between trees, a floor through which wild flowers pushed to show smiling faces, a column housing stray birds, temples and pyramids and baroque churches in the distance.    But when she saw four walls and a bed pushed against the corner as if it had been flying and had collided against an obstacle, she did not feel as other voyagers: "I have arrived at my destination and can now remove my traveling costume," but: "I have been captured and from here, sooner or later, I must escape." 
NinASHL.txt	69	0.4998	1954	Nin, Anais	A spy in the house of love	  These moments when she reached a humorous peak above the morass of dangers, the smothering swamps of guilt, were the ones when everyone left her alone, unabsolved; they seemed to be awaiting her hour of punishment after living like a spy in the house of many loves, for avoiding exposure, for defeating the sentinels watching definite boundaries, for passing without passports and permits from one love to another.    Every spy's life had ended in ignominious death.        She stood waiting for the light to change at the crossroad of the beach town.    What startled Sabina and made her examine the cyclist waiting beside her was the extraordinary brilliance of his large eyes. They shone with a wet, silver sparkle which was almost frightening because it highlighted the tumultuous panic close to the surface. The molten silver was disquieting, like blinding reflectors on the edge of annihilation by darkness. She was caught in the contagion of this panic, the transparent film of precious stone trembling, about to be sucked in by a hidden cyclone.    It was only later that she noticed the delicately chiseled face, the small nose, the mouth modeled by gentleness, unrelated to the deeper disturbance of the eyes, a very young man's mouth, a pure design on the face not yet enslaved by his feelings. These feelings not yet known to him, had not yet acid-bitten through his body. His gestures were free and nimble, the gestures of an adolescent, restless and light. The eyes alone contained all the fever. 
NinASHL.txt	79	5.0	1954	Nin, Anais	A spy in the house of love	  "You can if you wish."    "They will hear me."    "You know a great deal about war," said Sabina, "but I know a great deal about peace. There's a way you can come in and they will never hear you."    "Is that true?" But he was not reassured and she saw that he had merely shifted his mistrust of the critical family to mistrust of her knowledge of intrigue which made her a redoubtable opponent.    She was silent and made a gesture of abdication, starting to run towards the house. It was then he grasped her and kissed her almost desperately, digging his nervous, lithe fingers into her shoulders, into her hair, grasping her hair as if he were drowning, to hold her head against his as if she might escape his grasp.    "Let me come in with you."    "Then take off your shoes," she whispered.    He followed her.    "My room is on the first floor. Keep in step with me as we go up the stairs; they creak. But it will sound like one person." He smiled.    When they reached her room, and she closed the door, he examined his surroundings as if to assure himself he had not fallen into an enemy trap. 
NinASHL.txt	86	20.0	1954	Nin, Anais	A spy in the house of love	  She fled from the waves and his hands. But when she lay on the warm sand, it was his body again on which she lay; it was his dry skin and his swift elusive movements slipping through her fingers, shifting beneath her breasts. She fled from the sand of his caresses.    But when she bicycled home, she was racing him, she heard his merry challenges, faster—faster—faster in the wind, his face pursued her in flight or she pursued his face.    That night she raised her face to the moon, and the gesture awakened the pain, because to receive his kiss she had had to raise her face this way, but with the support of his two hands. Her mouth opened to receive his kiss once more but closed on emptiness. She almost shouted out with pain, shouted at the moon, the deaf, impassible goddess of desire shining down mockingly at an empty night, an empty bed.    She decided to pass once more by his house, although it was late, although she dreaded to see once more the empty dead face of his window.    His window was alight and open!    Sabina stood under it and whispered his name. She was hidden by a bush. She dreaded that anyone else in the house should hear her. She dreaded the eyes of the world upon a woman standing under a young man's window.    "John! John!" 
NinASHL.txt	89	0	1954	Nin, Anais	A spy in the house of love	  A vague physical resemblance, an almost similar mouth, a slightly similar voice, some particle of the character of Philip, or John, would emigrate to another, to whom she recognized immediately in a crowd, at a party, by the erotic resonance it reawakened.    The echoes struck at first through the mysterious instrumentation of the senses which retained sensations as instruments retain a sound after being touched. The body remained vulnerable to certain repetitions long after the mind believed it had made a clear, a final severance.    A similar design of a mouth was sufficient to retransmit the interrupted current of sensations, to recreate a contact by way of the past receptivity, like a channel conducting perfectly only a part of the former ecstasy through the channel of the senses arousing vibrations and sensibilities formerly awakened by a total love or total desire for the entire personality.    The senses created river beds of responses formed in part from the sediments, the waste, the overflow from the original experience. A partial resemblance could stir what remained of the imperfectly rooted-out love which had not died a natural death.    Whatever was torn out of the body, as out of the earth, cut, violently uprooted, left such deceptive, such lively roots below the surface, all ready to bloom again under an artificial association, by a grafting of sensation, given new life through this graft of memory. 
NinASHL.txt	105	1576800.0	1954	Nin, Anais	A spy in the house of love	  Alan always believed he was giving Sabina pleasure when he took her to the theatre, and at first her face was always illuminated with suspense and curiosity. But inevitably she would grow restive and tumultuous, chaotic and disturbed; she would even weep quietly in the dark and disappear in between acts, so as not to expose a ravaged face.    "What is it, what is it?" repeated Alan patiently, suspecting her of envy or jealousy of the roles given to others. "You could be the most marvelous actress of our period if you wanted to give your whole life to it, but you know how you feel about discipline and monotony."    "It isn't that, no, it isn't that," and Sabina would say no more.    To whom could she explain that what she envied in them was the ease with which they would step out of their roles, wash themselves of it after the play and return to their true selves. She would have wanted these metamorphoses of her personality to take place on the stage so that at a given signal she would know for certain they were ended and she might return to a permanent immutable Sabina. 
NinASHL.txt	111	5.0	1954	Nin, Anais	A spy in the house of love	  She stood before the paintings and she now could see the very minute fragments of her acts, which she had believed unimportant, causing minute incisions, erosions of the personality. A small act, a kiss given at a party to a young man who benefited from his resemblance to a lost John, a hand abandoned in a taxi to a man not desired but because the other woman's hand had been claimed and Sabina could not bear to have her hand lie unclaimed on her lap: it seemed an affront to her powers of seduction. A word of praise about a painting she had not liked but uttered out of fear that the painter would say: "Oh, Sabina... Sabina doesn't understand painting."    All the small insincerities had seeped like invisible rivulets of acid and caused profound damages. The erosions had sent each fragment of Sabina rotating like separate pieces of colliding planets into other spheres, yet not powerful enough to fly into space like a bird, not organic enough to become another life, to rotate on its own core.    Jay's painting was a dance of fragments to the rhythm of debris. It was also a portrait of the present Sabina.    And all her seeking of fire to weld these fragments together, seeking in the furnace of delight a welding of fragments into one total love, one total woman, had failed! 
NinASHL.txt	113	2.0	1954	Nin, Anais	A spy in the house of love	  "I haven't either," said Jay, with mock contrition. "I've just come home, because of the war. They asked us to leave. Whoever couldn't be drafted was only one more mouth to feed for France. The consulate sent us a messenger: 'Let all the useless ones leave Paris.' In one day all the artists deserted, as if the plague had come. I never knew the artists occupied so much space! We, the international artists, were faced with either hunger or concentration camps. Do you remember Hans, Sabina? They wanted to send him back to Germany. A minor Paul Klee, that's true, but still deserving a better fate. And Suzanne was sent back to Spain; she had no papers. Her Hungarian husband with the polio was put in a camp. Remember the corner of Montparnasse and Raspail where we all stood for hours saying good night? Because of the blackouts you'd have no time to say good night, you'd be lost as soon as you were out of the café, you'd vanish in the black night. Innocence was gone from all our acts. Our habitual state of rebellion became a serious political crime. Djuna's house boat was drafted for the transportation of coal. Everything could undergo conversion except the artists. How can you convert disorganizers of past and present order, the chronic dissenters, those dispossessed of the present anyway, the atom bomb throwers of the mind, of the emotions, seeking to generate new forces and a new order of mind out of continuous upheavals?" 
NinASHL.txt	133	2.5	1954	Nin, Anais	A spy in the house of love	I could step out of my ordinary self or my ordinary life into multiple selves and lives without attracting attention. I mean that my first crime, as you may be surprised to hear, was committed against myself. I was then a corrupter of minors, and this minor was myself. What I corrupted was what is called the truth in favor of a more marvelous world. I could always improve on the facts. I was never arrested for this: it concerned only myself. My parents were not wise enough to see that such prestigitation of facts might produce a great artist, or at least a great actress. They beat me, to shake out the dust of delusions. But strangely enough, the more my father beat me, the more abundantly did this dust gather again, and it was not gray or brown dust as you find it in its daily form, but what is known to adventurers as fool's gold. Give me your coat. As an investigator you may be more interested to know that in self defense, I accuse the writers of fairy tales. Not hunger, not cruelty, not my parents, but these tales which promised that sleeping in the snow never caused pneumonia, that bread never turned stale, that trees blossomed out of season, that dragons could be killed with courage, that intense wishing would be followed immediately by fulfillment of the wish. Intrepid wishing, said the fairytales, was more effective than labor. The smoke issuing from Aladdin's lamp was my first smokescreen, and the lies learned from fairy tales were my first perjuries. Let us say I had perverted tendencies: I believed everything I read. 
NinASHL.txt	139	3.0	1954	Nin, Anais	A spy in the house of love	  "My trap doors failed me."    "Come with me, Sabina."        Sabina and Djuna went up to her studio, where they could still hear the drumming.    As if to silence it, Djuna placed a record in her phonograph.    "Sabina..." But no words came as one of Beethoven's Quartets began to tell Sabina, as Djuna could not, of what they both knew for absolute certainty: the continuity of existence and of the chain of summits, of elevations by which such continuity is reached. By elevation the consciousness reached a perpetual movement, transcending death, and in the same manner attained the continuity of love by seizing upon its impersonal essence, which was a summation of all the alchemies producing life and birth, a child, a work of art, a work of science, a heroic act, an act of love. The identity or the human couple was not eternal but interchangeable, to protect this exchange of spirits, transmissions of character, all the fecundations of new selves being born, and faithfulness only to the continuity, the extensions and expansions of love achieving their crystallizations into high moments and summits equal to the high moments and summits of art or religion.    Sabina slid to the floor and sat there with her head against the phonograph, with her wide skirt floating for one instant like an expiring parachute; and then deflating completely and dying in the dust. 
NinASHL.txt	140	1.0	1954	Nin, Anais	A spy in the house of love	  The tears on Sabina's face were not round and separate like ordinary tears, but seemed to have fallen like a water veil, as if she had sunk to the bottom of the sea by the weight and dissolutions of the music. There was a complete dissolution of the eyes, features, as if she were losing her essence.    The lie detector held out his hands as if to rescue her, in a light gesture, as if this were a graceful dance of sorrow rather than the sorrow itself, and said: "In homeopathy there is a remedy called pulsatile for those who weep at music." 
FahsSJC.txt	0	60.0	1945	Fahs, Sophia Lyon	Jesus: the carpenter's son	JESUS    the Carpenter’s Son    “Is not this the carpenter’s son? Is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas? And his sisters, are they not all with us?”    —Matthew 13:55, 56            All jumped to their feet and looked out over the wide plain            Chapter 1    The Young Patriots    Late one afternoon on a rocky ledge overlooking the white flat roofs of the town of Nazareth sat five Jewish boys. They squirmed restlessly as they talked, now and then picking up loose pieces of rock and throwing them down the hillside. Zadok, the weaver’s boy; Joash, the stonemason’s son; David, the son of a shepherd; Zebedee, the potter’s son; and Jesus, son of Joseph the carpenter, made up the group.    These five boys had secretly banded together. They called themselves Young Patriots. Like all boys everywhere whose fathers plot and fight to free their countries from bondage to a foreign power, these boys also were determined to fight for their country’s liberty. Jesus was their latest recruit. The others had trusted him with their secret. They had begged him to join. They needed a boy with a mind like his. And Jesus was fascinated by their enthusiasm. He wanted to be at something worth while, but he was not sure he wanted to be a Young Patriot. He was feeling his way. 
FahsSJC.txt	1	2628000.0	1945	Fahs, Sophia Lyon	Jesus: the carpenter's son	  Zebedee and Zadok were the leaders. Just as soon as their parents would let them, they said, they were going to fight. They liked to sit together and dream of what they would do when they were men. They were going to be guerrillas. They would carry knives hidden in their garments. They would hide in caves and come out only at nighttime to plunder gardens and fields, to break into Roman armories to carry off money and swords. Then finally, when there were enough armed guerrillas, they would start a great rebellion and drive the hated Romans from the land.    Yes, this was what these Young Patriots were dreaming of doing when they were men. Zebedee’s father was already hiding with a rebel band somewhere among the rocky cliffs across the Lake of Galilee. Zadok’s father had fought with the great Judah when his guerrillas raided Sepphoris, a town only six miles from where the boys were then sitting. Zadok had heard the whole exciting story from his father’s own lips. The young fellow had told it over and over to the other boys: how the guerrillas had broken into the fortress on the hill and had run off with hundreds of Roman swords and spears; how they had stolen many bags full of money, and had successfully escaped; and how later they had gone secretly in and out of many towns of Galilee, robbing and killing not only Romans but anyone they suspected of being a traitor. Even though the boys at that time were but small children, they remembered sharing the excitement and fear they had felt in the people around them. 
FahsSJC.txt	8	1.4994	1945	Fahs, Sophia Lyon	Jesus: the carpenter's son	  “Was there as much fighting and killing when you were a boy, Father, as there is now?”    “Sometimes I think there was more, Son. You know I grew up under the rule of Herod the Great. It would be hard to imagine a king who could be more cruel than he.”    “Did you ever do any fighting yourself, Father?”    “No, Son, I never carried a sword, but I have watched the results of fighting by others. I’ve seen homes burned down and whole families left to beg—without a place to lay their heads.”    “Such things are still happening, Father.”    Joseph went on as if he had not heard Jesus’ remark. “I remember one black Passover as if it were only yesterday. It was a beautiful spring. I had gone as usual down to Jerusalem to attend the festival. You were just a small child then, Jesus. Thousands, yes, ten of thousands of pilgrims filled the big city and crowded the wide temple courts.”    “You’ll take me with you the next time you go to Jerusalem, won’t you, Father?” Jesus interrupted excitedly. 
FahsSJC.txt	23	180.0	1945	Fahs, Sophia Lyon	Jesus: the carpenter's son	  James brought a basin of water so that Jesus and his father might wash their feet. Simon brought a second basin and passed it to each one in turn until their hands also were washed. One of the daughters lighted two lamps and set them on the low supper table.    Father sat at the end with his oldest son on his right hand and his other children seated about him in the order of their ages. Then, taking a round, flat loaf of bread, the father broke it and, bowing his head, he said a prayer of thanksgiving. As long as Jesus could remember, his father had said these very same words every evening when the family sat down to supper. The mother then brought a big bowl of green vegetables from the fire, some goat’s milk, a jar of honey, and a few figs that had grown on the tree in the courtyard. They all ate and drank heartily for they were hungry after a long day.    Later in the evening when the other children were asleep on their mats, Jesus and his father sat alone together on the roof top. The street below was quiet and dark except for the flickering of small lights through open doorways. Above, the stars shone so big and bright in the dark sky that it seemed almost as though Jesus could reach out his hands and touch the stars with his fingers. In the quiet dark he felt somehow close to God, as if he were praying even though he was not saying a word. His thoughts were like a secret between himself and God. It was so different from the way he had felt when he had been listening to his father praying at the supper table. 
FahsSJC.txt	35	180.0	1945	Fahs, Sophia Lyon	Jesus: the carpenter's son	  With anxious hearts, the parents walked back to Jerusalem the next morning going from house to house where they had been at one time or another during their stay, but no Jesus was to be found. Finally, they decided to look for him in the temple. How astonished they were when, entering one of the cloisters among the pillars, they saw their son, sitting quietly, with older men all around him, listening to the rabbi! They heard Jesus ask a question. They trembled lest the teacher become annoyed by their son. But the teacher listened with interest and answered the boy’s question respectfully, and Jesus was all absorbed in what the teacher was saying.    Presently Jesus looked around and noticed his parents standing by the doorway watching him. He stepped out of the hall to speak with them.        Jesus sat down and listened, too    “Son, why have you behaved like this?” asked Mary. “Your father and I have been looking anxiously for you.”    “Mother, why have you been looking for me all over the city? Did you not know that I would be right here in the temple?”    But the parents could not understand their son. They told him he would have to go home with them at once, for the rest of the party were already on their way.    So Jesus’ dream of being with the great teachers to listen and to ask them questions came to an end. Soon he would be called a man and allowed to decide things for himself, but not yet. 
FahsSJC.txt	41	0.33320000000000005	1945	Fahs, Sophia Lyon	Jesus: the carpenter's son	Which of these rules was it really necessary to follow in order to be pleasing to God? Jesus had begun to feel that there was something wrong about some of the teachings given by the rabbis. He had come to think very much as the prophet Micah had long before: “And what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?” Yes, those were the important things—justice, kindness and a humble spirit. How relieved everyone was to hear Jesus say this! But sometimes Jesus wished he could talk things over with a really great teacher. The scribes[4] in the synagogue thought him ignorant since he had never gone to school in Jerusalem. At times Jesus felt lonely with his thoughts.    Then something happened that caused Jesus to change the plans for his life. He met a great preacher, and this is how it came about.    A traveling merchant passing through the town stopped at the carpenter’s shop to have a cart wheel repaired. The man had an exciting story to tell. Down in Judea near the banks of the Jordan he had heard a most extraordinary preacher.    “People by the hundreds are walking many miles to hear him. It’s not at all pleasant there in that wilderness, with the sun beating down on those dry, rocky cliffs. But still the people come in crowds. The preacher looks almost as wild as the country he lives in, with his long, uncut hair and his short tunic of camel’s skin. He’s stern, too, and almost fierce sometimes. He reminds me of what Elijah must have been like.”    “What is the man’s name?” asked Jesus. 
FahsSJC.txt	71	2.0	1945	Fahs, Sophia Lyon	Jesus: the carpenter's son	So, with a heart full of trouble, Nathan wandered in and out of the streets of Jerusalem, until at last he found lodging in a fisherman’s inn. There he became acquainted with a band of men who were on fire with a strange idea. They were robbers, but they thought themselves good robbers. Each night some of their number would raid some luxurious home in order to get back at least a little of the riches that had been stolen from the poor. Whatever these men pilfered from the rich, they would take great pleasure in giving away to their poor neighbors who were not even having enough to eat. It was strange how Nathan began to like these robbers. He was even persuaded to join them in one of their nightly raids.    “But Nathan was too good a man to be happy very long as a robber. When finally he awoke, as it were, from his bad dream, he was filled with shame. He felt he had knowingly done a great wrong. He had become a thief! God could never, never forgive him!    “Then Nathan’s heart began to dry up. He left the robbers and returned to Capernaum, but he could not bear to walk the streets of his home town. He did not care to meet his old friends. For a long time, he could not even tell his wife what had happened to him. He took to his bed. He had no appetite for eating.”    “Does Nathan think that God is still punishing him?” asked Jesus. 
FahsSJC.txt	75	5.0	1945	Fahs, Sophia Lyon	Jesus: the carpenter's son	  But a mumbling of angry voices rose from the crowd in the courtyard below. Jesus could not distinguish the words they were saying to one another, but he felt what they were thinking. Stepping nearer the wall, he looked down on the troubled crowd, and lifted his voice so that all could hear.    “You are wondering how I dare to speak for God. You are saying to yourselves, ‘Who can forgive sins but God alone?’ It is easy, in this case, to say ‘Your sins are forgiven!’ You know your good neighbor. You know how deeply he regrets his great mistake. It is right for us to assure such a man that he is forgiven.”    Then turning again to the weak and helpless man on his mat, Jesus said, “Nathan, stand up and walk! You need be sick no longer. Pick up your bed and go home.”    Then slowly, with a great effort, the man tried to lift his head. His weakness could not leave him in a moment, but his courage was coming back. His friends helped him gently to his feet, and then later they carried him down the stairs. In the courtyard Nathan put his feet on the ground. He took a step and then another. Two friends supported him. 
FahsSJC.txt	76	20160.0	1945	Fahs, Sophia Lyon	Jesus: the carpenter's son	  The people made way for them and followed after, out the gate in the wall. They were too deeply moved to have many words. Some shook their heads solemnly and said, “We have seen strange things today.”            Chapter 8    More About Forgiving    News of the change that had come over Nathan spread from house to house till the whole town knew the story. Indeed, the fame of the young preacher from Nazareth was being carried to other towns along the shore of the Galilean lake. Fishermen were finding excuses for guiding their sailboats into the wharf at Capernaum in the hope of catching sight of this unusual person of whom they were hearing. Crowds began to gather whenever the word was whispered that Jesus had been seen on the streets or was sitting on the beach beside the lake.    Nathan was a popular citizen of Capernaum and an honor to the society of Pharisees to which he belonged. To see him walking the streets once more chatting in his old friendly way was something to celebrate. When his neighbors saw him again at his potter’s wheel, they found excuses to buy his handiwork. There was beauty in the forms of the bowls and pitchers he molded. The Tyrian blue he used in painting them made his pottery even more distinctive. And when passers-by found Nathan in his garden in the cool of the day pulling weeds and hoeing the earth, then they were sure their friend was really well. 
FahsSJC.txt	97	2.0	1945	Fahs, Sophia Lyon	Jesus: the carpenter's son	  “You know not what you are asking. I have come neither to destroy nor to kill. I have come to call our people to join a kingdom of righteousness—a kingdom we must join one by one, when we make our hearts right with God. Of what value will it be to free ourselves from our Roman rulers if in so doing we ourselves become more cruel, more greedy, and more filled with hatred? The coming of the Kingdom of God does not need to wait for our freedom as a nation. We Jews are still free to worship God according to our own consciences. We are still free to be kind and considerate of others. We are still free to treat our neighbors as we should like to be treated ourselves. We are still free to be honest and to learn the truth and to live in its light. The only king in such a Kingdom is God himself.”    There was no uncertainty in Jesus’ speaking. He knew what he believed. As he spoke, the crowd slowly grew quiet as men must do when deep in their hearts they feel the power of truth. They sat awed in the presence of a great man—greater than they had supposed. They could not bow their knees, but they could humble their hearts.    Only two in all the crowd could put their feelings into words.    “Blessed is the woman who gave you birth,” called one. 
FahsSJC.txt	118	0	1945	Fahs, Sophia Lyon	Jesus: the carpenter's son	  It was not merely because Jesus seemed to be careless about obeying the Sabbath laws that some began to oppose him. It was also because of his attitude toward people whom the Pharisees regarded as disreputable citizens. Jesus was back once more in Capernaum and it distressed the synagogue leaders to be reminded again of the honor shown to Matthew, the former tax collector. A man in such a business they regarded as a traitor and a robber. They had not forgotten the big feast Matthew had given in Jesus’ honor and the other traitors and foreigners and thieves and even women with bad reputations who had been there.    The Pharisees taught that one-tenth of all food raised should be set aside for the temple. Also, it was forbidden to Jews to eat certain kinds of foods that foreigners ate freely. All meat had to be prepared according to the laws in the Bible. The Pharisees said that when the laws were not obeyed the food was “unclean,” and the persons who ate of it would also become “unclean”—that is, they would become unfit to go to the synagogue or to the temple to pray. The Pharisees said it was unworthy of a teacher to associate so freely with such people and to eat foods not properly prepared. To Jesus, however, obeying such rules seemed less important than helping people who were really hungry in their hearts for love and understanding. 
FahsSJC.txt	119	180.0	1945	Fahs, Sophia Lyon	Jesus: the carpenter's son	  In spite of these criticisms of Jesus, some of the Pharisees held him in high honor. They saw a nobility and a sincerity in him that they respected. One happy day, one of their number had the courage to invite Jesus to his own home for a feast. Jesus was glad to go.    As the guests were gathering, Jesus noticed how some began to choose the seats of honor nearest the host. But when the host himself arrived, he had to ask certain ones to give up their seats to the friends for whom he had planned the special honors. The disappointed ones were envious and hurt.    When the dinner was over and the company were sitting leisurely chatting, the host invited Jesus to talk a while to them. Because of what he had seen, there was but one matter that seemed important for the moment. It was a delicate subject to speak of, yet Jesus was not one to shrink from being outspoken and honest. In his usual open manner he spoke out his mind.    “When you are invited to a wedding feast, do not sit down in the chief seat, lest possibly a more honorable man than you be invited to sit there. He who gave the feast shall then come and say to you, ‘Give this man your place.’ Then you will be humiliated and you will have to go to the lowest place. 
FahsSJC.txt	146	2.0	1945	Fahs, Sophia Lyon	Jesus: the carpenter's son	          Chapter 15    The Singing Pilgrims    With bundles on their shoulders and money in their bags, the disciples were waiting for their Master to come so that they might start on their journey to attend the Passover festival. Since Jesus was determined to go, they had all decided to stay by him.    “Which way are we taking?” asked Peter of the others. “Will it be the short or the long way?”    “I hope it’s not the long way down through the Jordan Valley,” said Phillip. “It is so hot and sultry there and the wild animals frighten me at night.”    “But the short way,” said Judas, “is through Samaria. I simply cannot bear to sleep in the house of a Samaritan and eat food from his table.”    “And besides,” added Simon, “the Samaritans are dangerous. You remember the men from Capernaum who had to run for their lives out of one Samaritan village? They came near being stoned.”    “This quarreling between Jews and Samaritans is foolish,” broke in Thomas. “Of course, Samaritans are Jews just as much as we are.”    “No, they are not,” contradicted Judas. “They are half-breeds, with Babylonian blood in them.”    “To be sure, some of them have a little foreign blood in them, but what of it? They believe in God, just as we do; they want to worship him with sacrifices, just as we do; and they are diligent in obeying the law.
FahsSJC.txt	155	15.0	1945	Fahs, Sophia Lyon	Jesus: the carpenter's son	  Officers of the temple stood about here and there in the great court to direct the crowds and to answer questions.    “What kind of animal should I buy? I must confess my sins.”    “Where may I find the priest who will wash me clean with water, because I have eaten food prepared by foreigners?”    “Where shall I take these gifts—this bottle of wine and this bag of meal, which we have brought from our own vineyard and field?”    “Where shall I leave this sheep until my turn comes at the altar?”    There was much coming and going, pushing and worrying. Mothers tried to hold on to their children, and husbands tried to keep in touch with their wives.    Jesus and his companions soon edged their way through the crowds and up the fourteen steps leading to the Beautiful Gate of brass and on into the Court of the Women. There they found white-robed priests standing behind a row of large silver bowls, ready to receive the gifts of the worshipers. Into the first of these bowls, Jesus and his companions, one by one, dropped their half-shekels—the temple tax required of every Jew. Then each, according to his own desire, dropped other coins in other bowls. These were gifts of their own choosing—freewill offerings. Jesus put his into the bowl marked “for the poor.”    Then, when all had given their gifts, they sat down on benches arranged along the wall where they might rest awhile. On the steps leading to the next higher court, a white-gowned choir was singing, while men with harps and flutes and cymbals accompanied it. Now and again a priest would lead the worshipers in saying prayers. 
FahsSJC.txt	201	10080.0	1945	Fahs, Sophia Lyon	Jesus: the carpenter's son	  In addition to these experiences together, some had dreams in which Jesus came back and talked with them. In these dreams, Jesus seemed so real that the dreamers could not tell whether they had been asleep or awake when they saw him. Some declared positively that they had seen Jesus again. He had talked with them. They were sure of it. The rumor spread that Jesus had actually come out of his coffin, that Peter and John had seen him, and that several of the women also had talked with him; they would see him only for a few moments, and then he would mysteriously disappear again. Finally, several of them dreamed they saw Jesus rise up from the earth—higher and higher—until he disappeared entirely. They believed he had gone to heaven to be with God. And after that their dreams of seeing him and talking with him stopped.    But for these men and women to believe that God had brought Jesus back to life in this way after he had been killed made a tremendous impression. It changed even their memories of him. They believed as never before that Jesus was a Man of God, that he was different from other men. Perhaps his being killed, they said, was after all part of God’s plan. But what could that plan have been? It took time for them to work it all out, but some of them did. They decided that Jesus was truly the savior for whose coming they had been yearning, but that he was a savior for all the world, not for the Jews alone. They believed also that Jesus would actually come back again to live on this earth. He would come down from heaven through the clouds, and he would set up a great world kingdom. Jesus would become king of kings and lord of lords. The great dreams of the prophets for world-wide peace and righteousness would then come true. 
FahsSJC.txt	202	1051200000.0	1945	Fahs, Sophia Lyon	Jesus: the carpenter's son	  But the years passed by. The men and women who knew Jesus died. Their children and their children’s children also died. But Jesus did not come back. Nearly two thousand years have come and gone. Still Jesus has not come back. There are those who are still hoping for his second coming.    But others believe that this Jesus, the carpenter’s son, will never live again on the earth. What has been handed down to us from generation to generation regarding his life is the world’s great treasure. His spirit never needs to die. When he lived on the earth, only small groups could listen to his words. Today his teachings are heard and his story is told weekly in thousands of houses of worship. At first but a small circle of friends tried to spread his message. Now the followers of Jesus are numbered by the millions. They live in every land. They speak all languages. Just as a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, yet from it there grows a new plant that bears new fruit and new seeds, so was Jesus’ death. And so, he taught, the Kingdom of God would grow. And so the Kingdom of God continues to grow.    “The strong men keep coming on,    They go down shot, hanged, sick, broken. . . .    . . . . . . . . .    Call hallelujah, call amen, call deep thanks.    The strong men keep coming on.”[11]
WoodEEL.txt	0	1.0	1861	Wood, Ellen	East Lynne	  CHAPTER I.    THE LADY ISABEL.    In an easy-chair of the spacious and handsome library of his town-house,  sat William, Earl of Mount Severn. His hair was gray, the smoothness of  his expansive brow was defaced by premature wrinkles, and his once  attractive face bore the pale, unmistakable look of dissipation. One of  his feet was cased in folds of linen, as it rested on the soft velvet  ottoman, speaking of gout as plainly as any foot ever spoke yet. It  would seem--to look at the man as he sat there--that he had grown old  before his time. And so he had. His years were barely nine and forty,  yet in all save years, he was an aged man.    A noted character had been the Earl of Mount Severn. Not that he had  been a renowned politician, or a great general, or an eminent statesman,  or even an active member in the Upper House; not for any of these had  the earl's name been in the mouths of men. But for the most reckless  among the reckless, for the spendthrift among spendthrifts, for the  gamester above all gamesters, and for a gay man outstripping the gay--by  these characteristics did the world know Lord Mount Severn. It was said  his faults were those of his head; that a better heart or a more  generous spirit never beat in human form; and there was much truth in  this. It had been well for him had he lived and died plain William Vane. 
WoodEEL.txt	1	2.0	1861	Wood, Ellen	East Lynne	Up to his five and twentieth year, he had been industrious and steady,  had kept his terms in the Temple, and studied late and early. The sober  application of William Vane had been a by word with the embryo  barristers around; Judge Vane, they ironically called him; and they  strove ineffectually to allure him away to idleness and pleasure. But  young Vane was ambitious, and he knew that on his own talents and  exertions must depend his own rising in the world. He was of excellent  family, but poor, counting a relative in the old Earl of Mount Severn.  The possibility of his succeeding to the earldom never occurred to him,  for three healthy lives, two of them young, stood between him and the  title. Yet those have died off, one of apoplexy, one of fever, in  Africa, the third boating at Oxford; and the young Temple student,  William Vane, suddenly found himself Earl of Mount Severn, and the  lawful possessor of sixty thousand a year.    His first idea was, that he should never be able to spend the money;  that such a sum, year by year, could not be spent. It was a wonder his  head was not turned by adulation at the onset, for he was courted,  flattered and caressed by all classes, from a royal duke downward. He  became the most attractive man of his day, the lion in society; for  independent of his newly-acquired wealth and title, he was of  distinguished appearance and fascinating manners. But unfortunately, the  prudence which had sustained William Vane, the poor law student, in his  solitary Temple chambers entirely forsook William Vane, the young Earl  of Mount Severn, and he commenced his career on a scale of speed so  great, that all staid people said he was going to ruin and the deuce  headlong. 
WoodEEL.txt	208	2.5	1861	Wood, Ellen	East Lynne	  She was growing calmer. The passion was fading, leaving her face still  and white. She lifted it toward Mr. Carlyle.    "You treated me ill in showing signs of love, if you felt it not. Why  did you kiss me?"    "I kissed you as I might kiss a sister. Or perhaps as a pretty girl; man  likes to do so. The close terms on which our families have lived,  excused, if it did not justify, a degree of familiarity that might have  been unseemly in--"    "You need not tell me that," hotly interrupted Barbara. "Had it been a  stranger who had won my love and then thrown me from him, do you suppose  I would have reproached him as I am now reproaching you? No; I would  have died, rather than that he should have suspected it. If she had not  come between us, should you have loved me?"    "Do not pursue this unthankful topic," he besought, almost wishing the  staring cow would run away with her.    "I ask you, should you have loved me?" persisted Barbara, passing her  handkerchief over her ashy lips.    "I don't know. How can I know? Do I not say to you, Barbara, that I only  thought of you as a friend, a sister? I cannot tell what might have  been."    "I could bear it better, but that it was known," she murmured. "All West  Lynne had coupled us together in their prying gossip, and they have only  pity to cast on me now. I would far rather you have killed me,  Archibald." 
WoodEEL.txt	371	60.0	1861	Wood, Ellen	East Lynne	  This day she had partaken of her early dinner--such as it was, for her  appetite failed--and had dozed asleep in the arm chair, when a noise  arose from below, like a carriage driving into the courtyard through the  porte cochere. It instantly aroused her. Had he come?    "Who is it?" she asked of the nurse.    "Miladi, it is monsieur; and Pierre is with him. I have begged milady  often and often not to fret, for monsieur would surely come; miladi,  see, I am right."    The girl departed, closing the door, and Lady Isabel sat looking at it,  schooling her patience. Another moment, and it was flung open.    Sir Francis Levison approached to greet her as he came in. She waved him  off, begging him, in a subdued, quiet tone, not to draw too near, as any  little excitement made her faint now. He took a seat opposite to her,  and began pushing the logs together with his boot, as he explained that  he really could not get away from town before.    "Why did you come now?" she quietly rejoined.    "Why did I come?" repeated he. "Are these all the thanks a fellow gets  for travelling in this inclement weather? I thought you would at least  have been glad to welcome me, Isabel." 
WoodEEL.txt	399	15.0	1861	Wood, Ellen	East Lynne	  "Not as a husband!" repeated the exasperated justice. "Why, bless my  heart and body, the girl's going mad! Not as a husband! Who asked you to  like him as a husband before he became such? Did ever you hear that it  was necessary or expedient, or becoming for a young lady to act on and  begin to 'like' a gentleman as 'her husband?'"    Barbara felt a little bewildered.    "Here's the whole parish saying that Barbara Hare can't be married, that  nobody will have her, on account of--of--of that cursed stain left by---  -, I won't trust myself to name him, I should go too far. Now, don't you  think that's a pretty disgrace, a fine state of things?"    "But it is not true," said Barbara; "people do ask me."    "But what's the use of their asking when you say 'No?'" raved the  justice. "Is that the way to let the parish know that they ask? You are  an ungrateful, rebellious, self-willed daughter, and you'll never be  otherwise."    Barbara's tears flowed freely. The justice gave a dash at the bell  handle, to order the tea things carried away, and after their removal  the subject was renewed, together with Barbara's grief. That was the  worst of Justice Hare. Let him seize hold of a grievance, it was not  often he got upon a real one, and he kept on at it, like a blacksmith  hammering at his forge. In the midst of a stormy oration, tongue and  hands going together, Mr. Carlyle came in. 
WoodEEL.txt	545	20.0	1861	Wood, Ellen	East Lynne	  "Do you always take bread and milk?" she inquired, perceiving that to be  what they were eating.    "We get tired of it sometimes and then we have milk and water, and bread  and butter, or honey; and then we take to bread and milk again. It's  Aunt Cornelia who thinks we should eat bread and milk for breakfast. She  says papa never had anything else when he was a boy."    Lucy looked up.    "Papa would give me an egg when I breakfasted with him," cried she, "and  Aunt Cornelia said it was not good for me, but papa gave it to me all  the same. I always had breakfast with him then."    "And why do you not now?" asked Lady Isabel.    "I don't know. I have not since mamma came."    The word "stepmother" rose up rebelliously in the heart of Lady Isabel.  Was Mrs. Carlyle putting away the children from their father?    Breakfast over, she gathered them to her, asking them various questions  about their studies, their hours of recreation, the daily routine of  their lives.    "This is not the schoolroom, you know," cried William, when she made  some inquiry as to their books.    "No?"    "The schoolroom is upstairs. This is for our meals, and for you in an  evening."    The voice of Mr. Carlyle was heard at this juncture in the hall, and  Lucy was springing toward the sound. Lady Isabel, fearful lest he might  enter if the child showed herself, stopped her with a hurried hand. 
WoodEEL.txt	583	10.0	1861	Wood, Ellen	East Lynne	  And what of Blanche? Blanche was stunned. A despairing stupor took  possession of her; and, when she woke from it, desperation set in. She  insisted upon an interview with Sir Francis, and evade it he could not,  though he tried hard. Will it be believed that he denied the past--that  he met with mocking suavity her indignant reminders of what had been  between them? "Love! Marriage? Nonsense! Her fancy had been too much at  work." Finally, he defied her to prove that he had regarded her with  more than ordinary friendship, or had ever hinted at such a thing as a  union.    She could not prove it. She had not so much as a scrap of paper written  on by him; she had not a single friend or enemy to come forward and  testify that they heard him breathe to her a word of love. He had been  too wary for that. Moreover there was her own solemn protestations to  her sister Lydia that there was not anything between her and Francis  Levison; who would believe her if she veered round now, and avowed these  protestations were false? No; she found that she was in a sinking ship;  one there was no chance of saving. 
WoodEEL.txt	598	2.0	1861	Wood, Ellen	East Lynne	  A silent courtesy from Madame Vine. She turned away her head and gasped  for breath.    "Is your papa at home, Lucy?" cried the earl.    "Yes; I think he is at breakfast. I'm so glad you are come!"    Lord Mount Severn walked on, holding William by the hand, who had  eagerly offered to "take him" to papa. Lord Vane bent over Lucy to kiss  her. A little while, a very few more years, and my young lady would not  hold up her rosy lips so boldly.    "You have grown a dearer girl than ever, Lucy. Have you forgotten our  compact?"    "No," laughed she.    "And you will not forget it?"    "Never," said the child, shaking her head. "You shall see if I do."    "Lucy is to be my wife," cried he, turning to Madame Vine. "It is a  bargain, and we have both promised. I mean to wait for her till she is  old enough. I like her better than anybody else in the world."    "And I like him," spoke up Miss Lucy. "And it's all true."    Lucy was a child--it may almost be said an infant--and the viscount was  not of an age to render important such avowed passions. Nevertheless,  the words did thrill through the veins of the hearer. She spoke, she  thought, not as Madame Vine would have spoken and thought, but as the  unhappy mother, the ill-fated Lady Isabel.    "You must not say these things to Lucy. It could never be." 
WoodEEL.txt	714	2.0	1861	Wood, Ellen	East Lynne	  "With an intention of marrying her?"    "Well--no," cried Mr. Ebenezer, with a twist of the mouth; "I should not  suppose he entertained any intention of the sort. He used to come over  from Swainson, or its neighborhood, riding a splendid horse."    "Whom did you suppose him to be?"    "I supposed him to be moving in the upper ranks of life. There was no  doubt of it. His dress, his manners, his tone, all proclaimed it. He  appeared to wish to shun observation, and evidently did not care to be  seen by any of us. He rarely arrived until twilight."    "Did you see him there on the night of Hallijohn's murder?"    "No. I was not there myself that evening, so could not have seen him."    "Did a suspicion cross your mind at any time that he may have been  guilty of the murder?"    "Never. Richard Hare was accused of it by universal belief, and it never  occurred to me to suppose he had not done it."    "Pray, how many years is this ago?" sharply interrupted Mr. Rubiny,  perceiving that the witness was done with.    "Let's see!" responded Mr. Ebenezer. "I can't be sure as to a year  without reckoning up. A dozen, if not more."    "And you mean to say that you can swear to Sir Francis Levison being  that man, with all these years intervening?"    "I swear that he is the man. I am as positive of his identity as I am of  my own." 
WoodEEL.txt	735	10.0	1861	Wood, Ellen	East Lynne	  Mr. Carlyle glanced carelessly at the trinket, and at Madame Vine's  white fingers. He crossed to the door of his dressing-room and opened  it, then held out his hand in silence for Barbara to approach and drew  her in with him. Madame Vine went on with her work.    Presently Barbara returned, and approached the table where stood Madame  Vine, while she drew on her gloves. Her eyelashes were wet.    "I could not help shedding a few tears of joy," exclaimed Barbara, with  a pretty blush, perceiving that madame observed the signs. "Mr. Carlyle  has been telling me that my brother's innocence is now all but patent to  the world. It came out upon the examination of those two men, Sir  Francis and Otway Bethel. Lord Mount Severn was present at the  proceedings, and says they have in some way incriminated each other.  Papa sat in his place as chairman; I wonder that he liked to do so."    Lower bent the head of Madame Vine over her employment. "Has anything  been proved against them?" she asked, in her usual soft tone, almost a  whisper.    "There is not the least doubt of the guilt of Levison, but Otway  Bethel's share in the affair is a puzzle yet," replied Mrs. Carlyle.  "Both are committed for trial. Oh, that man! that man! how his sins come  out!" she continued in excitement.    Madame Vine glanced up through her spectacles. 
WoodEEL.txt	742	3.0	1861	Wood, Ellen	East Lynne	Carlyle disappeared. Barbara had taken off her own warm night-gown then,  and put it upon William in place of his cold one--had struck a light and  was busily dressing herself.    "Just feel his night-gown Archibald! Wilson--"    A shrill cry of awful terror interrupted the words, and Mr. Carlyle made  one bound out again. Barbara followed; the least she thought was that  Wilson had dropped the baby in the hall.    That was not the catastrophe. Wilson, with the baby and Lucy, had  already disappeared up the staircase, and Madame Vine was disappearing.  Archibald lay on the soft carpet of the corridor, where madame had  stood; for Joyce, in the act of taking him, had let him slip to the  ground--let him fall from sheer terror. She held on to the balustrades,  her face ghastly, her mouth open, her eyes fixed in horror--altogether  an object to look upon. Archie gathered himself on his sturdy legs, and  stood staring.    "Why, Joyce! What is the matter with you?" cried Mr. Carlyle. "You look  as if you had seen a spectre."    "Oh, master!" she wailed, "I have seen one."    "Are you all going deranged together?" retorted he, wondering what had  come to the house. "Seen a spectre, Joyce?"    Joyce fell on her knees, as if unable to support herself, and crossed  her shaking hands upon her chest. Had she seen ten spectres she could  not have betrayed more dire distress. She was a sensible and faithful  servant, one not given to flights of fancy, and Mr. Carlyle gazed at her  in very amazement. 
WoodEEL.txt	757	2.0	1861	Wood, Ellen	East Lynne	  "Did you follow him?"    "No. I wondered what had happened to put him in that state; but I made  haste to the cottage, intending to reproach Afy with her duplicity. I  leaped up the two steps, and fell over the prostrate body of Hallijohn.  He was lying dead within the door. My gun, just discharged, was flung on  the floor, its contents in Hallijohn's side."    You might have heard a pin drop in court, so intense was the interest.    "There appeared to be no one in the cottage, upstairs or down. I called  to Afy, but she did not answer. I caught up the gun, and was running  from the cottage when Locksley came out of the wood and looked at me. I  grew confused, fearful, and I threw the gun back again and made off."    "What were your motives for acting in that way?"    "A panic had come over me, and in that moment I must have lost the use  of my reason, otherwise I never should have acted as I did. Thoughts,  especially of fear, pass through our minds with astonishing swiftness,  and I feared lest the crime should be fastened upon me. It was fear made  me snatch up my gun, lest it should be found near the body; it was fear  made me throw it back again when Locksley appeared in view--a fear you  understand, from which all judgment, all reason, had departed. But for  my own conduct, the charge never would have been laid to me." 
WoodEEL.txt	771	4.0	1861	Wood, Ellen	East Lynne	  "Jesus has promised to come for His own redeemed--for those who love Him  and wait for Him."    "Yes, yes, and then I shall be happy forever. It will be so pleasant to  be there, never to be tired or ill again."    "Pleasant? Ay! Oh, William! Would that the time were come!"    She was thinking of herself--of her freedom--though the boy knew it not.  She buried her face in her hands and continued speaking; William had to  bend his ear to catch the faint whisper.    "'And there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying: neither  shall there be any more pain; for the former things are passed away.'"    "Madame Vine, do you think mamma will be there?" he presently asked. "I  mean mamma that was."    "Ay, ere long."    "But how shall I know her? You see, I have nearly forgotten what she was  like."    She leaned over him, laying her forehead upon his wasted arm, and burst  into a flood of impassioned tears. "You will know her, never fear,  William; she has not forgotten you."    "But how can we be sure that she will be there?" debated William, after  a pause of thought. "You know"--sinking his voice, and speaking with  hesitation--"she was not quite good; she was not good enough to papa or  to us. Sometimes I think, suppose she did not grow good, and did not ask  God to forgive her!" 
WoodEEL.txt	783	4.0	1861	Wood, Ellen	East Lynne	  Lucy, a sensitive child, broke into a loud storm of sobs, enough to  disturb the equanimity of any sober sick room. Wilson hastened in at the  sound, and Mr. Carlyle sent the two children away, with soothing  promises that they should see William in the morning, if he continued  well enough.    Down on her knees, her face buried in the counterpane, a corner of it  stuffed into her mouth that it might help to stifle her agony, knelt  Lady Isabel. The moment's excitement was well nigh beyond her strength  of endurance. Her own child--his child--they alone around its death-bed,  and she might not ask or receive a word of comfort, of consolation!    Mr. Carlyle glanced at her as he caught her choking sobs just as he  would have glanced at any other attentive governess--feeling her  sympathy, doubtless, but nothing more; she was not heart and part with  him and his departing boy. Lower and lower bent he over that boy; for  his eyes were wet. "Don't cry, papa," whispered William, raising his  feeble hand caressingly to his father's cheek, "I am not afraid to go.  Jesus is coming for me."    "Afraid to go! Indeed I hope not, my gentle boy. You are going to God--  to happiness. A few years--we know not how few--and we shall all come to  you."    "Yes, you will be sure to come; I know that. I shall tell mamma so. I  dare say she is looking out for me now. Perhaps she's standing on the  banks of the river, watching the boats." 
WoodEEL.txt	847	7.0	1861	Wood, Ellen	East Lynne	  There was a pause. Mr. Carlyle began to perceive that his wife's face  was hidden from him.    "She said her heart was broken. Barbara, we cannot wonder at it."    There was no reply. Mr. Carlyle took his arm from the mantelpiece, and  moved so that he could see her countenance: a wan countenance, telling  of pain.    He laid his hand upon her shoulder, and made her look at him. "My  dearest, what is this?"    "Oh, Archibald!" she uttered, clasping her hands together, all her pent  up feelings bursting forth, and the tears streaming from her eyes, "has  this taken your love from me?"    He took both her hands in one of his, he put the other round her waist  and held her there, before him, never speaking, only looking gravely  into her face. Who could look at its sincere truthfulness, at the sweet  expression of his lips, and doubt him? Not Barbara. She allowed the  moment's excitement to act upon her feelings, and carry her away.    "I had thought my wife possessed entire trust in me."    "Oh, I do, I do; you know I do. Forgive me, Archibald," she slowly  whispered.    "I deemed it better to impart this to you, Barbara. Had there been wrong  feeling on my part, I should have left you in ignorance. My darling, I  have told you it in love."    She was leaning on his breast, sobbing gently, her repentant face turned  towards him. He held her there in his strong protection, his enduring  tenderness. 
WoodEEL.txt	848	2.0	1861	Wood, Ellen	East Lynne	  "My wife! My darling! now and always."    "It was a foolish feeling to cross my heart, Archibald. It is done with  and gone."    "Never let it come back, Barbara. Neither need her name be mentioned  again between us. A barred name it has hitherto been; so let it  continue."    "Anything you will. My earnest wish is to please you; to be worthy of  your esteem and love, Archibald," she timidly added, her eye-lids  drooping, and her fair cheeks blushing, as she made the confession.  "There has been a feeling in my heart against your children, a sort of  jealous feeling, you can understand, because they were hers; because she  had once been your wife. I knew how wrong it was, and I have tried  earnestly to subdue it. I have, indeed, and I think it is nearly gone,"  her voice sunk. "I constantly pray to be helped to do it; to love them  and care for them as if they were my own. It will come with time."    "Every good thing will come with time that we may earnestly seek," said  Mr. Carlyle. "Oh, Barbara, never forget--never forget that the only way  to ensure peace in the end is to strive always to be doing right,  unselfishly under God." 
JameHPL.txt	0	240.0	1881	James, Henry	Portrait of a Lady	THE PORTRAIT OF A LADY        CHAPTER I    Under certain circumstances there are few hours in life more agreeable  than the hour dedicated to the ceremony known as afternoon tea. There  are circumstances in which, whether you partake of the tea or not--some  people of course never do,--the situation is in itself delightful. Those  that I have in mind in beginning to unfold this simple history offered  an admirable setting to an innocent pastime. The implements of  the little feast had been disposed upon the lawn of an old English  country-house, in what I should call the perfect middle of a splendid  summer afternoon. Part of the afternoon had waned, but much of it was  left, and what was left was of the finest and rarest quality. Real dusk  would not arrive for many hours; but the flood of summer light had begun  to ebb, the air had grown mellow, the shadows were long upon the smooth,  dense turf. They lengthened slowly, however, and the scene expressed  that sense of leisure still to come which is perhaps the chief source  of one's enjoyment of such a scene at such an hour. From five o'clock to  eight is on certain occasions a little eternity; but on such an occasion  as this the interval could be only an eternity of pleasure. The persons  concerned in it were taking their pleasure quietly, and they were not  of the sex which is supposed to furnish the regular votaries of the  ceremony I have mentioned.
JameHPL.txt	1	45.0	1881	James, Henry	Portrait of a Lady	The shadows on the perfect lawn were straight  and angular; they were the shadows of an old man sitting in a deep  wicker-chair near the low table on which the tea had been served, and  of two younger men strolling to and fro, in desultory talk, in front of  him. The old man had his cup in his hand; it was an unusually large cup,  of a different pattern from the rest of the set and painted in brilliant  colours. He disposed of its contents with much circumspection, holding  it for a long time close to his chin, with his face turned to the house.  His companions had either finished their tea or were indifferent to  their privilege; they smoked cigarettes as they continued to stroll.  One of them, from time to time, as he passed, looked with a certain  attention at the elder man, who, unconscious of observation, rested his  eyes upon the rich red front of his dwelling. The house that rose beyond  the lawn was a structure to repay such consideration and was the most  characteristic object in the peculiarly English picture I have attempted  to sketch. 
JameHPL.txt	32	1.0	1881	James, Henry	Portrait of a Lady	Isabel,  however, gave as little heed as possible to cosmic treacheries; she kept  her eyes on her book and tried to fix her mind. It had lately occurred  to her that her mind was a good deal of a vagabond, and she had spent  much ingenuity in training it to a military step and teaching it  to advance, to halt, to retreat, to perform even more complicated  manoeuvres, at the word of command. Just now she had given it marching  orders and it had been trudging over the sandy plains of a history of  German Thought. Suddenly she became aware of a step very different from  her own intellectual pace; she listened a little and perceived that some  one was moving in the library, which communicated with the office. It  struck her first as the step of a person from whom she was looking for a  visit, then almost immediately announced itself as the tread of a  woman and a stranger--her possible visitor being neither. It had an  inquisitive, experimental quality which suggested that it would not stop  short of the threshold of the office; and in fact the doorway of this  apartment was presently occupied by a lady who paused there and looked  very hard at our heroine. She was a plain, elderly woman, dressed in  a comprehensive waterproof mantle; she had a face with a good deal of  rather violent point.    "Oh," she began, "is that where you usually sit?" She looked about at  the heterogeneous chairs and tables. 
JameHPL.txt	93	14480.0	1881	James, Henry	Portrait of a Lady	Touchett, but which he had now ceased to enjoy. Isabel enjoyed it  largely and, handling the reins in a manner which approved itself to  the groom as "knowing," was never weary of driving her uncle's capital  horses through winding lanes and byways full of the rural incidents she  had confidently expected to find; past cottages thatched and timbered,  past ale-houses latticed and sanded, past patches of ancient common and  glimpses of empty parks, between hedgerows made thick by midsummer. When  they reached home they usually found tea had been served on the lawn  and that Mrs. Touchett had not shrunk from the extremity of handing her  husband his cup. But the two for the most part sat silent; the old  man with his head back and his eyes closed, his wife occupied with her  knitting and wearing that appearance of rare profundity with which some  ladies consider the movement of their needles.    One day, however, a visitor had arrived. The two young persons, after  spending an hour on the river, strolled back to the house and perceived  Lord Warburton sitting under the trees and engaged in conversation, of  which even at a distance the desultory character was appreciable, with  Mrs. Touchett. He had driven over from his own place with a portmanteau  and had asked, as the father and son often invited him to do, for a  dinner and a lodging.
JameHPL.txt	161	2.0	1881	James, Henry	Portrait of a Lady	  "I shall not keep you in suspense; I only want to collect my mind a  little."    He gave a melancholy sigh and stood looking at her a moment, with his  hands behind him, giving short nervous shakes to his hunting-crop. "Do  you know I'm very much afraid of it--of that remarkable mind of yours?"    Our heroine's biographer can scarcely tell why, but the question made  her start and brought a conscious blush to her cheek. She returned his  look a moment, and then with a note in her voice that might almost have  appealed to his compassion, "So am I, my lord!" she oddly exclaimed.    His compassion was not stirred, however; all he possessed of the faculty  of pity was needed at home. "Ah! be merciful, be merciful," he murmured.    "I think you had better go," said Isabel. "I'll write to you."    "Very good; but whatever you write I'll come and see you, you know." And  then he stood reflecting, his eyes fixed on the observant countenance of  Bunchie, who had the air of having understood all that had been said  and of pretending to carry off the indiscretion by a simulated fit of  curiosity as to the roots of an ancient oak. "There's one thing more," 
JameHPL.txt	267	2.0	1881	James, Henry	Portrait of a Lady	  "Who's that with me--is it my son?" the old man asked.    "Yes, it's your son, daddy."    "And is there no one else?"    "No one else."    Mr. Touchett said nothing for a while; and then, "I want to talk a  little," he went on.    "Won't it tire you?" Ralph demurred.    "It won't matter if it does. I shall have a long rest. I want to talk  about _you_."    Ralph had drawn nearer to the bed; he sat leaning forward with his hand  on his father's. "You had better select a brighter topic."    "You were always bright; I used to be proud of your brightness. I should  like so much to think you'd do something."    "If you leave us," said Ralph, "I shall do nothing but miss you."    "That's just what I don't want; it's what I want to talk about. You must  get a new interest."    "I don't want a new interest, daddy. I have more old ones than I know  what to do with."    The old man lay there looking at his son; his face was the face of the  dying, but his eyes were the eyes of Daniel Touchett. He seemed to be  reckoning over Ralph's interests. "Of course you have your mother," he  said at last. "You'll take care of her."    "My mother will always take care of herself," Ralph returned.    "Well," said his father, "perhaps as she grows older she'll need a  little help." 
JameHPL.txt	289	1.0	1881	James, Henry	Portrait of a Lady	But you may depend on it that every one bears some mark; even the  hardest iron pots have a little bruise, a little hole somewhere. I  flatter myself that I'm rather stout, but if I must tell you the truth  I've been shockingly chipped and cracked. I do very well for service  yet, because I've been cleverly mended; and I try to remain in the  cupboard--the quiet, dusky cupboard where there's an odour of stale  spices--as much as I can. But when I've to come out and into a strong  light--then, my dear, I'm a horror!"    I know not whether it was on this occasion or on some other that the  conversation had taken the turn I have just indicated she said to Isabel  that she would some day a tale unfold. Isabel assured her she should  delight to listen to one, and reminded her more than once of this  engagement. Madame Merle, however, begged repeatedly for a respite, and  at last frankly told her young companion that they must wait till they  knew each other better. This would be sure to happen, a long friendship  so visibly lay before them. Isabel assented, but at the same time  enquired if she mightn't be trusted--if she appeared capable of a  betrayal of confidence.    "It's not that I'm afraid of your repeating what I say," her fellow  visitor answered; "I'm afraid, on the contrary, of your taking it too  much to yourself. You'd judge me too harshly; you're of the cruel age." 
JameHPL.txt	296	2.0	1881	James, Henry	Portrait of a Lady	With the poor old father it's different; he has his identity, and it's  rather a massive one. He represents a great financial house, and that,  in our day, is as good as anything else. For an American, at any rate,  that will do very well. But I persist in thinking your cousin very lucky  to have a chronic malady so long as he doesn't die of it. It's much  better than the snuffboxes. If he weren't ill, you say, he'd do  something?--he'd take his father's place in the house. My poor child, I  doubt it; I don't think he's at all fond of the house. However, you know  him better than I, though I used to know him rather well, and he may  have the benefit of the doubt. The worst case, I think, is a friend  of mine, a countryman of ours, who lives in Italy (where he also was  brought before he knew better), and who is one of the most delightful  men I know. Some day you must know him. I'll bring you together and then  you'll see what I mean. He's Gilbert Osmond--he lives in Italy; that's  all one can say about him or make of him. He's exceedingly clever, a  man made to be distinguished; but, as I tell you, you exhaust the  description when you say he's Mr. Osmond who lives _tout bêtement_ in  Italy. No career, no name, no position, no fortune, no past, no future,  no anything.
JameHPL.txt	450	1.4994	1881	James, Henry	Portrait of a Lady	Why should she mark so one of his values--quite the wrong one--when she  would have nothing to do with another, which was quite the right? He was  angry with himself for being puzzled, and then angry for being angry.  Verdi's music did little to comfort him, and he left the theatre and  walked homeward, without knowing his way, through the tortuous, tragic  streets of Rome, where heavier sorrows than his had been carried under  the stars.    "What's the character of that gentleman?" Osmond asked of Isabel after  he had retired.    "Irreproachable--don't you see it?"    "He owns about half England; that's his character," Henrietta remarked.  "That's what they call a free country!"    "Ah, he's a great proprietor? Happy man!" said Gilbert Osmond.    "Do you call that happiness--the ownership of wretched human beings?"  cried Miss Stackpole. "He owns his tenants and has thousands of them.  It's pleasant to own something, but inanimate objects are enough for me.  I don't insist on flesh and blood and minds and consciences."    "It seems to me you own a human being or two," Mr. Bantling suggested  jocosely. "I wonder if Warburton orders his tenants about as you do me."    "Lord Warburton's a great radical," Isabel said. "He has very advanced  opinions."    "He has very advanced stone walls. His park's enclosed by a gigantic  iron fence, some thirty miles round," Henrietta announced for the  information of Mr. Osmond. "I should like him to converse with a few of  our Boston radicals." 
JameHPL.txt	682	1.0	1881	James, Henry	Portrait of a Lady	Stackpole." The Countess pressed her finger-tips to her forehead; she  didn't remember to have known any such Henrietta as that. The servant  then remarked that the lady had requested him to say that if the  Countess should not recognise her name she would know her well enough on  seeing her. By the time she appeared before her visitor she had in fact  reminded herself that there was once a literary lady at Mrs. Touchett's;  the only woman of letters she had ever encountered--that is the only  modern one, since she was the daughter of a defunct poetess. She  recognised Miss Stackpole immediately, the more so that Miss Stackpole  seemed perfectly unchanged; and the Countess, who was thoroughly  good-natured, thought it rather fine to be called on by a person of that  sort of distinction. She wondered if Miss Stackpole had come on account  of her mother--whether she had heard of the American Corinne. Her mother  was not at all like Isabel's friend; the Countess could see at a  glance that this lady was much more contemporary; and she received  an impression of the improvements that were taking place--chiefly in  distant countries--in the character (the professional character) of  literary ladies. Her mother had been used to wear a Roman scarf thrown  over a pair of shoulders timorously bared of their tight black velvet  (oh the old clothes!) and a gold laurel-wreath set upon a multitude of  glossy ringlets. She had spoken softly and vaguely, with the accent of  her "Creole"
JameHPL.txt	694	3.0	1881	James, Henry	Portrait of a Lady	  "I suppose I've seen it, but I didn't know it was yours. I don't  remember pictures--especially that sort." She had pointed out her  favourite work, and he asked her if it was about Correggio she wished to  talk with him.    "No," said Henrietta, "it's about something less harmonious!" They  had the small, brilliant room, a splendid cabinet of treasures, to  themselves; there was only a custode hovering about the Medicean Venus.  "I want you to do me a favour," Miss Stackpole went on.    Caspar Goodwood frowned a little, but he expressed no embarrassment at  the sense of not looking eager. His face was that of a much older man  than our earlier friend. "I'm sure it's something I shan't like," he  said rather loudly.    "No, I don't think you'll like it. If you did it would be no favour."    "Well, let's hear it," he went on in the tone of a man quite conscious  of his patience.    "You may say there's no particular reason why you should do me a favour.  Indeed I only know of one: the fact that if you'd let me I'd gladly do  you one." Her soft, exact tone, in which there was no attempt at effect,  had an extreme sincerity; and her companion, though he presented rather  a hard surface, couldn't help being touched by it. When he was touched  he rarely showed it, however, by the usual signs; he neither blushed,  nor looked away, nor looked conscious. He only fixed his attention more  directly; he seemed to consider with added firmness. Henrietta continued  therefore disinterestedly, without the sense of an advantage. "I may say  now, indeed--it seems a good time--that if I've ever annoyed you (and  I think sometimes I have) it's because I knew I was willing to suffer  annoyance for you. I've troubled you--doubtless. But I'd _take_ trouble  for you." 
JameHPL.txt	731	2.0	1881	James, Henry	Portrait of a Lady	  "I think I see what you mean," said Isabel.    "Where's the letter you told me he had written me?" her husband  demanded.    "I haven't the least idea; I haven't asked him."    "You stopped it on the way," said Osmond.    Isabel slowly got up; standing there in her white cloak, which covered  her to her feet, she might have represented the angel of disdain, first  cousin to that of pity. "Oh, Gilbert, for a man who was so fine--!" she  exclaimed in a long murmur.    "I was never so fine as you. You've done everything you wanted. You've  got him out of the way without appearing to do so, and you've placed  me in the position in which you wished to see me--that of a man who has  tried to marry his daughter to a lord, but has grotesquely failed."    "Pansy doesn't care for him. She's very glad he's gone," Isabel said.    "That has nothing to do with the matter."    "And he doesn't care for Pansy."    "That won't do; you told me he did. I don't know why you wanted this  particular satisfaction," Osmond continued; "you might have taken some  other. It doesn't seem to me that I've been presumptuous--that I have  taken too much for granted. I've been very modest about it, very quiet.  The idea didn't originate with me. He began to show that he liked her  before I ever thought of it. I left it all to you." 
JameHPL.txt	732	14400.0	1881	James, Henry	Portrait of a Lady	  "Yes, you were very glad to leave it to me. After this you must attend  to such things yourself."    He looked at her a moment; then he turned away. "I thought you were very  fond of my daughter."    "I've never been more so than to-day."    "Your affection is attended with immense limitations. However, that  perhaps is natural."    "Is this all you wished to say to me?" Isabel asked, taking a candle  that stood on one of the tables.    "Are you satisfied? Am I sufficiently disappointed?"    "I don't think that on the whole you're disappointed. You've had another  opportunity to try to stupefy me."    "It's not that. It's proved that Pansy can aim high."    "Poor little Pansy!" said Isabel as she turned away with her candle.        CHAPTER XLVII    It was from Henrietta Stackpole that she learned how Caspar Goodwood had  come to Rome; an event that took place three days after Lord Warburton's  departure. This latter fact had been preceded by an incident of some  importance to Isabel--the temporary absence, once again, of Madame  Merle, who had gone to Naples to stay with a friend, the happy possessor  of a villa at Posilippo. Madame Merle had ceased to minister to Isabel's  happiness, who found herself wondering whether the most discreet of  women might not also by chance be the most dangerous. Sometimes, at  night, she had strange visions; she seemed to see her husband and her  friend--his friend--in dim, indistinguishable combination. It seemed to  her that she had not done with her; this lady had something in reserve. 
JameHPL.txt	800	2.0	1881	James, Henry	Portrait of a Lady	  "He'll say now that you're not wise," said Isabel, as if Gilbert Osmond  had never said this before.    Rosier gave her a sharp look. "Do you mean that without my bibelots I'm  nothing? Do you mean they were the best thing about me? That's what they  told me in Paris; oh they were very frank about it. But they hadn't seen  <i>her</i>!"    "My dear friend, you deserve to succeed," said Isabel very kindly.    "You say that so sadly that it's the same as if you said I shouldn't."  And he questioned her eyes with the clear trepidation of his own. He had  the air of a man who knows he has been the talk of Paris for a week and  is full half a head taller in consequence, but who also has a painful  suspicion that in spite of this increase of stature one or two persons  still have the perversity to think him diminutive. "I know what happened  here while I was away," he went on; "What does Mr. Osmond expect after  she has refused Lord Warburton?"    Isabel debated. "That she'll marry another nobleman."    "What other nobleman?"    "One that he'll pick out."    Rosier slowly got up, putting his watch into his waistcoat-pocket.  "You're laughing at some one, but this time I don't think it's at me."    "I didn't mean to laugh," said Isabel. "I laugh very seldom. Now you had  better go away." 
JameHPL.txt	901	20.0	1881	James, Henry	Portrait of a Lady	  "Ah, don't say that. Don't kill me!" he cried.    She clasped her hands; her eyes were streaming with tears. "As you love  me, as you pity me, leave me alone!"    He glared at her a moment through the dusk, and the next instant she  felt his arms about her and his lips on her own lips. His kiss was like  white lightning, a flash that spread, and spread again, and stayed; and  it was extraordinarily as if, while she took it, she felt each thing in  his hard manhood that had least pleased her, each aggressive fact of his  face, his figure, his presence, justified of its intense identity and  made one with this act of possession. So had she heard of those wrecked  and under water following a train of images before they sink. But when  darkness returned she was free. She never looked about her; she only  darted from the spot. There were lights in the windows of the house;  they shone far across the lawn. In an extraordinarily short time--for  the distance was considerable--she had moved through the darkness (for  she saw nothing) and reached the door. Here only she paused. She looked  all about her; she listened a little; then she put her hand on the  latch. She had not known where to turn; but she knew now. There was a  very straight path.    Two days afterwards Caspar Goodwood knocked at the door of the house in  Wimpole Street in which Henrietta Stackpole occupied furnished lodgings. 
JameHPL.txt	902	2.0	1881	James, Henry	Portrait of a Lady	He had hardly removed his hand from the knocker when the door was opened  and Miss Stackpole herself stood before him. She had on her hat and  jacket; she was on the point of going out. "Oh, good-morning," he said,  "I was in hopes I should find Mrs. Osmond."    Henrietta kept him waiting a moment for her reply; but there was a good  deal of expression about Miss Stackpole even when she was silent. "Pray  what led you to suppose she was here?"    "I went down to Gardencourt this morning, and the servant told me she  had come to London. He believed she was to come to you."    Again Miss Stackpole held him--with an intention of perfect kindness--in  suspense. "She came here yesterday, and spent the night. But this  morning she started for Rome."    Caspar Goodwood was not looking at her; his eyes were fastened on the  doorstep. "Oh, she started--?" he stammered. And without finishing  his phrase or looking up he stiffly averted himself. But he couldn't  otherwise move.    Henrietta had come out, closing the door behind her, and now she put out  her hand and grasped his arm. "Look here, Mr. Goodwood," she said; "just  you wait!"    On which he looked up at her--but only to guess, from her face, with a  revulsion, that she simply meant he was young. She stood shining at him  with that cheap comfort, and it added, on the spot, thirty years to his  life. She walked him away with her, however, as if she had given him now  the key to patience.

Yossarian was in the hospital with a pain in his liver that fell just short of being jaundice. The doctors were puzzled by the fact that it wasn’t quite jaundice. If it became jaundice they could treat it. If it didn’t become jaundice and went away they could discharge him. But this just being short of jaundice all the time confused them.    Each morning they came around, three brisk and serious men with efficient mouths and inefficient eyes, accompanied by brisk and serious Nurse Duckett, one of the ward nurses who didn’t like Yossarian. They read the chart at the foot of the bed and asked impatiently about the pain. They seemed irritated when he told them it was exactly the same.    “Still no movement?” the full colonel demanded.    The doctors exchanged a look when he shook his head.    “Give him another pill.”    Nurse Duckett made a note to give Yossarian another pill, and the four of them moved along to the next bed. None of the nurses liked Yossarian. Actually, the pain in his liver had gone away, but Yossarian didn’t say anything and the doctors never suspected. They just suspected that he had been moving his bowels and not telling anyone. 
HellJC.txt	1	10080.0	1955	Heller, Joseph	Catch-22	  Yossarian had everything he wanted in the hospital. The food wasn’t too bad, and his meals were brought to him in bed. There were extra rations of fresh meat, and during the hot part of the afternoon he and the others were served chilled fruit juice or chilled chocolate milk. Apart from the doctors and the nurses, no one ever disturbed him. For a little while in the morning he had to censor letters, but he was free after that to spend the rest of each day lying around idly with a clear conscience. He was comfortable in the hospital, and it was easy to stay on because he always ran a temperature of 101. He was even more comfortable than Dunbar, who had to keep falling down on his face in order to get his meals brought to him in bed.    After he made up his mind to spend the rest of the war in the hospital, Yossarian wrote letters to everyone he knew saying that he was in the hospital but never mentioning why. One day he had a better idea. To everyone he knew he wrote that he was going on a very dangerous mission. “They asked for volunteers. It’s very dangerous, but someone has to do it. I’ll write you the instant I get back.” And he had not written anyone since. 
HellJC.txt	95	2.0	1955	Heller, Joseph	Catch-22	  Milo grew flustered. “You don’t understand,” he protested. “He stole the whole bedsheet, and I got it back with the package of pitted dates you invested. That’s why the quarter of the bedsheet is yours. You made a very handsome return on your investment, particularly since you’ve gotten back every pitted date you gave me.” Milo next addressed himself to McWatt. “Half the bedsheet is yours because it was all yours to begin with, and I really don’t understand what you’re complaining about, since you wouldn’t have any of it if Captain Yossarian and I hadn’t intervened in your behalf.”    “Who’s complaining?” McWatt exclaimed. “I’m just trying to figure out what I can do with half a bedsheet.”    “There are lots of things you can do with half a bedsheet,” Milo assured him. “The remaining quarter of the bedsheet I’ve set aside for myself as a reward for my enterprise, work and initiative. It’s not for myself, you understand, but for the syndicate. That’s something you might do with half the bed-sheet. You can leave it in the syndicate and watch it grow.”    “What syndicate?”    “The syndicate I’d like to form someday so that I can give you men the good food you deserve.”    “You want to form a syndicate?”    “Yes, I do. No, a mart. Do you know what a mart is?”    “It’s a place where you buy things, isn’t it?”    “And sell things,” corrected Milo. 
HellJC.txt	242	3.0	1955	Heller, Joseph	Catch-22	  “Perchè?”    “Because you say you love me. How can you love a girl who is not a virgin?”    “Because I can’t marry you.”    She bolted right up again in a threatening rage. “Why can’t you marry me?” she demanded, ready to clout him again if he gave an uncomplimentary reply. “Just because I am not a virgin?”    “No, no, darling. Because you’re crazy.”    She stared at him in blank resentment for a moment and then tossed her head back and roared appreciatively with hearty laughter. She gazed at him with new approval when she stopped, the lush, responsive tissues of her dark face turning darker still and blooming somnolently with a swelling and beautifying infusion of blood. Her eyes grew dim. He crushed out both their cigarettes, and they turned into each other wordlessly in an engrossing kiss just as Hungry Joe came meandering into the room without knocking to ask if Yossarian wanted to go out with him to look for girls. Hungry Joe stopped on a dime when he saw them and shot out of the room. Yossarian shot out of bed even faster and began shouting at Luciana to get dressed. The girl was dumbfounded. He pulled her roughly out of bed by her arm and flung her away toward her clothing, then raced for the door in time to slam it shut as Hungry Joe was running back in with his camera. Hungry Joe had his leg wedged in the door and would not pull it out. 
HellJC.txt	307	20160.0	1955	Heller, Joseph	Catch-22	  The only one who lived with the chaplain in his clearing in the woods was Corporal Whitcomb, his assistant. Corporal Whitcomb, an atheist, was a disgruntled subordinate who felt he could do the chaplain’s job much better than the chaplain was doing it and viewed himself, therefore, as an underprivileged victim of social inequity. He lived in a tent of his own as spacious and square as the chaplain’s. He was openly rude and contemptuous to the chaplain once he discovered that the chaplain would let him get away with it. The borders of the two tents in the clearing stood no more than four or five feet apart.    It was Colonel Korn who had mapped out this way of life for the chaplain. One good reason for making the chaplain live outside the Group Headquarters building was Colonel Korn’s theory that dwelling in a tent as most of his parishioners did would bring him into closer communication with them. Another good reason was the fact that having the chaplain around Headquarters all the time made the other officers uncomfortable. It was one thing to maintain liaison with the Lord, and they were all in favor of that; it was something else, though, to have Him hanging around twenty-four hours a day. All in all, as Colonel Korn described it to Major Danby, the jittery and goggle-eyed group operations officer, the chaplain had it pretty soft; he had little more to do than listen to the troubles of others, bury the dead, visit the bedridden and conduct religious services.
HellJC.txt	310	3.0	1955	Heller, Joseph	Catch-22	  Corporal Whitcomb walked in a moment later and demanded, “What’s doing?”    “There isn’t anything new,” the chaplain replied with averted eyes. “Was anyone here to see me?”    “Just that crackpot Yossarian again. He’s a real troublemaker, isn’t he?”    “I’m not so sure he’s a crackpot,” the chaplain observed.    “That’s right, take his part,” said Corporal Whitcomb in an injured tone, and stamped out.    The chaplain could not believe that Corporal Whitcomb was offended again and had really walked out. As soon as he did realize it, Corporal Whitcomb walked back in.    “You always side with other people,” Corporal Whitcomb accused. “You don’t back up your men. That’s one of the things that’s wrong with you.”    “I didn’t intend to side with him,” the chaplain apologized. “I was just making a statement.”    “What did Colonel Cathcart want?”    “It wasn’t anything important. He just wanted to discuss the possibility of saying prayers in the briefing room before each mission.”    “All right, don’t tell me,” Corporal Whitcomb snapped and walked out again.    The chaplain felt terrible. No matter how considerate he tried to be, it seemed he always managed to hurt Corporal Whitcomb’s feelings. He gazed down remorsefully and saw that the orderly forced upon him by Colonel Korn to keep his tent clean and attend to his belongings had neglected to shine his shoes again.

Just tell you to go ahead?”    “That’s all I need from you,” Dobbs answered. “Just tell me to go ahead and I’ll blow his brains out all by myself the day after tomorrow.” His voice was accelerating with emotion and rising again. “I’d like to shoot Colonel Korn in the head, too, while we’re at it, although I’d like to spare Major Danby, if that’s all right with you. Then I’d like to murder Appleby and Havermeyer also, and after we finish murdering Appleby and Havermeyer I’d like to murder McWatt.”    “McWatt?” cried Yossarian, almost jumping up in horror. “McWatt’s a friend of mine. What do you want from McWatt?”    “I don’t know,” Dobbs confessed with an air of floundering embarrassment. “I just thought that as long as we were murdering Appleby and Havermeyer we might as well murder McWatt too. Don’t you want to murder McWatt?”    Yossarian took a firm stand. “Look, I might keep interested in this if you stop shouting it all over the island and if you stick to killing Colonel Cathcart. But if you’re going to turn this into a blood bath, you can forget about me.”    “All right, all right.” Dobbs sought to placate him. “Just Colonel Cathcart. Should I do it?
HellJC.txt	363	2.5	1955	Heller, Joseph	Catch-22	  “Well, Vittorio,” said Milo, settling back lazily in one of Vittorio’s barber chairs, “how were things in my absence this time?”    “Very sad, Signor Milo, very sad. But now that you are back, the people are all happy again.”    “I was wondering about the size of the crowds. How come all the hotels are full?”    “Because so many people from other cities are here to see you, Signor Milo. And because we have all the buyers who have come into town for the artichoke auction.”    Milo’s hand soared up perpendicularly like an eagle and arrested Vittorio’s shaving brush. “What’s artichoke?” he inquired.    “Artichoke, Signor Milo? An artichoke is a very tasty vegetable that is popular everywhere. You must try some artichokes while you are here, Signor Milo. We grow the best in the world.”    “Really?” said Milo. “How much are artichokes selling for this year?”    “It looks like a very good year for artichokes. The crops were very bad.”    “Is that a fact?” mused Milo, and was gone, sliding from his chair so swiftly that his striped barber’s apron retained his shape for a second or two after he had gone before it collapsed. Milo had vanished from sight by the time Yossarian and Orr rushed after him to the doorway.

That won’t be very much longer then, considering that you’re so gullible and brave and that I am already such an old, old man.”    “How old are you?” Nately asked, growing intrigued and charmed with the old man in spite of himself.    “A hundred and seven.” The old man chuckled heartily at Nately’s look of chagrin. “I see you don’t believe that either.”    “I don’t believe anything you tell me,” Nately replied, with a bashful mitigating smile. “The only thing I do believe is that America is going to win the war.”    “You put so much stock in winning wars,” the grubby iniquitous old man scoffed. “The real trick lies in losing wars, in knowing which wars can be lost. Italy has been losing wars for centuries, and just see how splendidly we’ve done nonetheless. France wins wars and is in a continual state of crisis. Germany loses and prospers. Look at our own recent history. Italy won a war in Ethiopia and promptly stumbled into serious trouble. Victory gave us such insane delusions of grandeur that we helped start a world war we hadn’t a chance of winning. But now that we are losing again, everything has taken a turn for the better, and we will certainly come out on top again if we succeed in being defeated.”    Nately gaped at him in undisguised befuddlement. “Now I really don’t understand what you’re saying.

I hope you don’t feel you’re better than the rest of us just because you’re a professional man.”    “Oh, no, sir,” the chaplain assured him with embarrassment. “As a matter of fact, I have been going to the officers’ club the past few evenings.”    “You’re only a captain, you know,” Colonel Cathcart continued, paying no attention to the chaplain’s remark. “You may be a professional man, but you’re still only a captain.”    “Yes, sir. I know.”    “That’s fine, then. It’s just as well you didn’t laugh before. I wouldn’t have given you the plum tomatoes anyway. Corporal Whitcomb tells me you took a plum tomato when you were in here this morning.”    “This morning? But, sir! You gave it to me.”    Colonel Cathcart cocked his head with suspicion. “I didn’t say I didn’t give it to you, did I? I merely said you took it. I don’t see why you’ve got such a guilty conscience if you really didn’t steal it. Did I give it to you?”    “Yes, sir. I swear you did.”    “Then I’ll just have to take your word for it.

Nurse Duckett took him by his ear and put him back in bed.            • • 27 • •        Nurse Duckett        Nurse Sue Ann Duckett was a tall, spare, mature, straight-backed woman with a prominent, well-rounded ass, small breasts and angular, ascetic New England features that came equally close to being very lovely and very plain. Her skin was white and pink, her eyes small, her nose and chin slender and sharp. She was able, prompt, strict and intelligent. She welcomed responsibility and kept her head in every crisis. She was adult and self-reliant, and there was nothing she needed from anyone. Yossarian took pity and decided to help her.    Next morning while she was standing bent over smoothing the sheets at the foot of his bed, he slipped his hand stealthily into the narrow space between her knees and, all at once, brought it up swiftly under her dress as far as it would go. Nurse Duckett shrieked and jumped into the air a mile, but it wasn’t high enough, and she squirmed and vaulted and seesawed back and forth on her divine fulcrum for almost a full fifteen seconds before she wiggled free finally and retreated frantically into the aisle with an ashen, trembling face.
HellJC.txt	490	3.0	1955	Heller, Joseph	Catch-22	  Yossarian sighed drearily and began brooding about the rumored mission to Bologna. The valve Orr was dismantling was about the size of a thumb and contained thirty-seven separate parts, excluding the casing, many of them so minute that Orr was required to pinch them tightly between the tips of his fingernails as he placed them carefully on the floor in orderly, catalogued rows, never quickening his movements or slowing them down, never tiring, never pausing in his relentless, methodical, monotonous procedure unless it was to leer at Yossarian with maniacal mischief. Yossarian tried not to watch him. He counted the parts and thought he would go clear out of his mind. He turned away, shutting his eyes, but that was even worse, for now he had only the sounds, the tiny, maddening, indefatigable, distinct clicks and rustles of hands and weightless parts. Orr was breathing rhythmically with a noise that was stertorous and repulsive. Yossarian clenched his fists and looked at the long bone-handled hunting knife hanging in a holster over the cot of the dead man in the tent. As soon as he thought of stabbing Orr, his tension eased. The idea of murdering Orr was so ridiculous that he began to consider it seriously with queer whimsy and fascination. He searched the nape of Orr’s neck for the probable site of the medulla oblongata. Just the daintiest stick there would kill him and solve so many serious, agonizing problems for them both. 
HellJC.txt	544	20.0	1955	Heller, Joseph	Catch-22	  Yossarian was warm when the cold weather came because of Orr’s marvelous stove, and he might have existed in his warm tent quite comfortably if not for the memory of Orr, and if not for the gang of animated roommates that came swarming inside rapaciously one day from the two full combat crews Colonel Cathcart had requisitioned—and obtained in less than forty-eight hours—as replacements for Kid Sampson and McWatt. Yossarian emitted a long, loud, croaking gasp of protest when he trudged in tiredly after a mission and found them already there.    There were four of them, and they were having a whale of a good time as they helped each other set up their cots. They were horsing around. The moment he saw them, Yossarian knew they were impossible. They were frisky, eager and exuberant, and they had all been friends in the States. They were plainly unthinkable. They were noisy, overconfident, empty-headed kids of twenty-one. They had gone to college and were engaged to pretty, clean girls whose pictures were already standing on the rough cement mantelpiece of Orr’s fireplace. They had ridden in speedboats and played tennis. They had been horseback riding. One had once been to bed with an older woman. They knew the same people in different parts of the country and had gone to school with each other’s cousins. They had listened to the World Series and really cared who won football games. They were obtuse; their morale was good. They were glad that the war had lasted long enough for them to find out what combat was really like. They were halfway through unpacking when Yossarian threw them out.

Are there atheists in foxholes?”    “I don’t know, sir,” the chaplain replied. “I’ve never been in a foxhole.”    The officer in front swung his head around swiftly with a quarrelsome expression. “You’ve never been in heaven either, have you? But you know there’s a heaven, don’t you?”    “Or do you?” said the colonel.    “That’s a very serious crime you’ve committed, Father,” said the major.

What do you say? Will you keep your mouth shut and let me catch a ride?”    Major Danby regarded Yossarian in silence, with a strange, sad smile. He had stopped sweating and seemed absolutely calm. “What would you do if I did try to stop you?” he asked with rueful mockery. “Beat me up?”    Yossarian reacted to the question with hurt surprise. “No, of course not. Why do you say that?”    “I will beat you up,” boasted the chaplain, dancing up very close to Major Danby and shadowboxing. “You and Captain Black, and maybe even Corporal Whitcomb. Wouldn’t it be wonderful if I found I didn’t have to be afraid of Corporal Whitcomb any more?”    “Are you going to stop me?” Yossarian asked Major Danby, and gazed at him steadily.    Major Danby skipped away from the chaplain and hesitated a moment longer. “No, of course not!” he blurted out, and suddenly was waving both arms toward the door in a gesture of exuberant urgency. “Of course I won’t stop you. Go, for God’s sake, and hurry! Do you need any money?”    “I have some money.”    “Well, here’s some more.” With fervent, excited enthusiasm, Major Danby pressed a thick wad of Italian currency upon Yossarian and clasped his hand in both his own, as much to still his own trembling fingers as to give encouragement to Yossarian.

Thanks, Danby.”    “How do you feel, Yossarian?”    “Fine. No, I’m very frightened.”    “That’s good,” said Major Danby. “It proves you’re still alive. It won’t be fun.”    Yossarian started out. “Yes it will.”    “I mean it, Yossarian. You’ll have to keep on your toes every minute of every day. They’ll bend heaven and earth to catch you.”    “I’ll keep on my toes every minute.”    “You’ll have to jump.”    “I’ll jump.”    “Jump!” Major Danby cried.    Yossarian jumped.

I FEAR I must trouble my reader with some  few details as to the early life of Miss Mackenzie,  — details which will be dull in the telling, but which  shall be as short as I can make them. Her father,  who had in early life come from Scotland to London,  had spent all his days in the service of his country.  He became a clerk in Somerset House at the age  of sixteen, and was a clerk in Somerset House  when he died at the age of sixty. Of him no  more shall be said than that his wife had died  before him, and that he, at dying, left behind him  two sons and a daughter.  Thomas Mackenzie, the eldest of those two  sons, had engaged himself in commercial pursuits,  — as his wife was accustomed to say when she  spoke of her husband's labours; or went into  trade, and kept a shop, as was more generally  asserted by those of the Mackenzie circle who  were wont to speak their minds freely. The  actual and unvarnished truth in the matter shall  now be made known. He, with his partner,  made and sold oilcloth, and was possessed of pre  VOL. I. I  2 MISS MACKENZIE.

As you, my reader, might enter therein,  and purchase a yard and a half of oilcloth, if you  were so minded, I think that the freespoken friends  of the family were not far wrong. Mrs. Thomas  Mackenzie, however, declared that she was calumniated,  and her husband cruelly injured; and she  based her assertions on the fact that 'Rubb and  Mackenzie' had wholesale dealings, and that they  sold their article to the trade, who re sold it.  Whether or no she was ill-treated in the matter,  I will leave my readers to decide, having told  them all that it is necessary for them to know,  in order that a judgement may be formed.  Walter Mackenzie, the second son, had been  placed in his father's office, and he also had died  before the time at which our story is supposed'  to commence. He had been a poor sickly creature,  always ailing, gifted with an affectionate  nature, and a great respect for the blood of the  Mackenzies, but not gifted with much else that was  intrinsically his own. The blood of the Mackenzies  was, according to his way of thinking, very pure  blood indeed; and he had felt strongly that his  brother had disgraced the family by connecting  himself with that man Rubb, in the New Road. 
TrolAM.txt	24	2880.0	1865	Trollope, Anthony,	Miss Mackenzie	Sir John Ball, the other  baronet, had absolutely come to her, and had  seen her. There had been a regular scene of  reconciliation, and she had gone down for a day  and night to the Cedars. Sir John also was an  old man, being over seventy, and Lady Ball was  nearly as old. Mr. Ball, the future baronet, had  MISS MACKENZIE GOES TO LITTLEBATH. 21  also been there. He was a widower, with a large  family and small means. He had been, and of  course still was, a barrister; but as a barrister  he had never succeeded, and was now waiting  sadly till he should inherit the very moderate  fortune which would come to him at his father's  death. The Balls, indeed, had not done well with  their baronetcy, and their cousin found them  living with a degree of strictness, as to small  expenses, which she herself had never been  called upon to exercise. Lady Ball indeed had  a carriage, — for what would a baronet's wife do  without one? — but it did not very often go out.  And the Cedars was an old place, with grounds  and paddocks appertaining; but the ancient solitary  gardener could not make much of the  grounds, and the grass of the paddocks was always  sold. Margaret, when she was first asked  to go to the Cedars, felt that it would be better  for her to give up her migration to Littlebath.

That  lady said nothing about the assembly rooms, nor  did she speak of the Stumfoldian manner of life.  Her husband had no doubt explained to her that  the stranger was not as yet a declared disciple  in either school. Miss Mackenzie had wished to  ask a question about the assemblies, but had  been deterred by fear. Then came Mr. Stumfold  in person, and, of course, nothing about the  assembly rooms was said by him. He made himself  very pleasant, and Miss Mackenzie almost  resolved to put herself into his hands. He did  not look sour at her, nor did he browbeat her  with severe words, nor did he exact from her  the performance of any hard duties. He promised  to find her a seat in his church, and told her  what were the hours of service. He had three  'Sabbath services, ' but he thought that regular  attendance twice every Sunday was enough for  people in general. He would be delighted to be  of use, and Mrs. Stumfold should come and call.  Having promised this, he went his way. Then  came Mrs. Stumfold, according to promise, bringing  with her one Miss Baker, a maiden lady. From  Mrs. Stumfold our friend got very little assistance. 
TrolAM.txt	180	180.0	1865	Trollope, Anthony,	Miss Mackenzie	Miss Mackenzie at once made up her mind that  her money was gone! But, in truth, this did not  much annoy her. She had declared to herself  once before that if anything was wrong about the  money she would regard it as a present made to  her brother; and when so thinking of it, she had,  undoubtedly, felt that it was, not improbably, lost  to her. It was something over a hundred a year  to be deducted from her computed income, but  she would still be able to live at the Paragon  quite as well as she had intended, and be able  also to educate Susanna. Indeed, she could do this  easily and still save money, and, therefore, as  regarded the probable loss, why need she be unhappy?    Before the morning was over she had succeeded  in white washing Mr. Rubb in her own mind.  It is, I think, certainly the fact that women are  less pervious to ideas of honesty than men are.  They are less shocked by dishonesty when they  find it, and are less clear in their intellect as to  PLENARY ABSOLUTION. 157  that which constitutes honesty. Where is the woman  who thinks it wrong to smuggle? What  lady's conscience ever pricked her in that she  omitted the armorial bearings on her silver forks  from her tax papers? What wife ever ceased to  respect her husband because he dealt dishonestly  in business? Whereas, let him .not go to church,  let him drink too much wine, let him go astray  in his conversation, and her wrath arises against  these faults. But this lack of feminine accuracy  in the matter of honesty tends rather to charity  in their judgement of others, than to deeds of fraud  on the part of women themselves.

But  Miss Mackenzie, when she was left alone, went  upstairs, threw herself on her bed, and was again  dissolved in tears.  CHAPTER Xin.  MR. MAGUIRE's COURTSHIP.  AFTER the scene between Miss Mackenzie and  Miss Baker more than a week passed by before  Miss Mackenzie saw any of her Littlebath friends;  or, as she called them with much sadness when  speaking of them to herself, her Littlebath acquaintances.  Friends, or friend, she had none. It was  a slow, heavy week with her, and it is hardly  too much to say that every hour in it was spent  in thinking of the attack which Mrs. Stumfold  had made upon her. When the first Sunday  came, she went to church, and saw there Miss  Baker, and Mrs. Stumfold, and Mr. Stumfold and  Mr. Maguire. She saw, indeed, many Stumfoldians,  but it seemed that their eyes looked at her harshly,  and she was quite sure that the coach maker  wife treated her with marked incivility as they  left the porch together. Miss Baker had frequently  waited for her on Sunday mornings, and walked  the length of two streets with her; but she encountered  no Miss Baker near the church gate  on this morning, and she was sure that Mrs.

Then there's an'end of that, I  suppose, ' said Mr. Slow.  'Exactly so. I have been explaining to my  cousin all about it. I hope the firm will be able  to pay my sister-in-law the interest of it, but that  does not seem sure.'  'I am afraid I cannot help you there, Miss  Mackenzie.'  28 MISS MACKENZIE.  'Of course not. I was not thinking of it. But  what I'Ve come about is this.' Then she told Mr.  Slow the whole of her project with reference to  her fortune; how, on his deathbed, she had promised  to give half of all that she had to her brother's  wife and family, and how she had come there to  him, with her cousin, in order that he might put  her in the way of keeping her promise.  Mr. Slow sat in silence and patiently heard her  to the end. She, finding herself thus encouraged  to speak, expatiated on the solemnity of her promise,  and declared that she could not be comfortable  till she had done all that she had undertaken  to perform. 'And I shall have quite enough for  myself afterwards, Mr. Slow, quite enough.'  Mr. Slow did not say a word till she had done,  and even then he seemed to delay his speech. John  Ball never raised his face from his umbrella, but  sat looking at the lawyer, whom he still suspected  of roguery. And if the lawyer were a rogue,  what then about his cousin? It must not be supposed  that he suspected her; but what would come of  her, if the fortune she held were, in truth, not  her own?'  'I have told my cousin all about it, ' continued  Margaret, 'and I believe that he thinks I am doing  right. At any rate, I would do nothing without  his knowing it  'I think she is giving her sister-in-law too much, '  said John Ball. 
TrolAM.txt	326	15.0	1865	Trollope, Anthony,	Miss Mackenzie	'John, ' she said, when they had walked half  the length of that side of the square, 'I have  heard dreadful news.'  Then that deed of gift was, after all, a fact;  and Mr. Slow, instead of being a rogue, must be  the honestest old lawyer in London! He must  have been at work in discovering the wrong that  had been done, and was now about to reveal it  TRIBULATION. 33  to the world. Some such idea as this had glimmered  across Mr. Ball's mind as he had sat in  Mr. Slow's outer office, with his chin still resting  on his umbrella.  But though some such idea as this did cross  his mind, his thought on the instant was of his  cousin.  'What dreadful news, Margaret?'  'It is about my money.'  'Stop a moment, Margaret. Are you sure that  you ought to tell it to me?'  'If I don't, to whom shall I tell it? And how  can I bear it without telling it to some one?'  'Did Mr. Slow bid you speak of it to me?'  'No; he bade me think much of it before I  did so, as you are concerned. And he said that  you might perhaps be disappointed.'  Then they walked on again in silence. John  Ball found his position to be very difficult, and  hardly knew how to speak to her, or how to carry  himself. If it was to be that this money was to  come back to him; if it was his now in spite of  all that had come and gone; if the wrong done  was to be righted, and the property wrested  from him was to be restored, — restored to him  who wanted it so sorely, — how could he not  triumph in such an act of tardy restitution? He  remembered all the particulars at this moment.

BEHAVED. 75  To this he made no answer, but went upstairs  to his bedroom, and there, as he dressed, thought  again, and again, and again of his cousin Margaret.  What should he do for her, and in what way  should he treat her? The very name of the  Mackenzies he had hated of old, and their names  were now more hateful to him than ever. He had  correctly described his own feelings towards them  when he said, either truly or untruly, that they  had deprived him of that which would have made  his whole life prosperous instead of the reverse.  And it seemed as though he had really thought  that they had been in fault in this; — that they had  defrauded him. It did not, apparently, occur to  him that the only persons he could blame were  his uncle Jonathan and his own lawyers, who,  at his uncle's death, had failed to discover in  his behalf what really were his rights. Walter  Mackenzie had been a poor creature who could  do nothing. Tom Mackenzie had been a mean  creature who had allowed himself to be cozened  in a petty trade out of the money which he had  wrongfully acquired. They were odious to him,  and he hated their memories. He would fain have  hated all that belonged to them, had he been  able. But he was not able to hate this woman  who clung to him, and trusted him, and felt no  harsh feelings towards him, though he was going  to take from her everything that had been hers.

Mr. Maguire had da'  his letter from Littlebath, and there the ans  reached him. He had returnd thither, ha  found that he could take no further immedi  steps towards furthering his cause in London.  And now, what steps should he take nes  More than once he thought of putting his o  case into the hands of a lawyer; but what  a lawyer to do for him? An action for breach of  promise' was open to him, but he had wit enough  to feel that there was very little chance of success  for him in that line. He might instruct a lawyer  to look into Miss Mackenzie's affairs, and he  thought it probable that he might find a lawyer  to take such instructions. But there would be  much expense in this, and, probably, no result.  Advancing logically from one conclusion to another,  he at last resolved that he must rush boldly into  print, and lay the whole iniquity of the transaction  open to the public.  He believed, — I think he did believe, — that the  woman was being wronged. Some particle of such  belief he had, and fostering himself with this, he  sat himself down, and wrote a leading article. 
TrolAM.txt	464	0	1865	Trollope, Anthony,	Miss Mackenzie	i 'Not long ago there was a lady in this  town, loved and respected by all who knew her.'  Thus he began, and then gave a not altogether  inaccurate statement of the whole affair, dropping,  of course, his own share in the concern,  and accusing the vile, wicked, hideous, loathsome  human heart of the devouring lion, who lived  some miles to the west end of London, of a  brutal desire and a hellish scheme to swallow  up the inheritance of the innocent, loved, and  respected lamb, in spite of the closest ties of  consanguinity between them. And then he went  152 MISS MACKENZIE.  on to tell how, with a base desire of covering  up from the eyes of an indignant public his bestial  greediness in having made this dishonest meal,  the lion had proposed to himself the plan of  marrying the lamb! It was a pity that Maguire  had not learned, — that Miss Colza had not been  able to tell him, — that the lion had once before  expressed his wish to take the lamb for his wife.  Had he known that, what a picture he would  have drawn of the disappointed vindictive king  of the forest, as lying in his lair at Twickenham  he meditated his foul revenge! This unfortunately  was unknown to Mr. Maguire and unsuspected  by him.  But the article did not end here. The indignant  writer of it went on to say that he had  buckled on his armour in support of the lamb,  and that he was ready to meet the lion either  in the forest or in any social circle; either in the  courts of law or before any Christian arbitrator.

'I mean the whole family, including  those dear girls to whom I have been in the  position of a mother since my son's wife died.  It is in the name of the Ball family that I now  speak, and surely I have a right.'  Margaret thought that Lady Ball had no such  right, but she would not say so at that moment.  ' Well, Margaret, to come to the point at once,  the fact is this. You must renounce any idea that  you may still have of becoming my son's wife.'  Then she paused.  'Has John sent you here to say this?' demanded  Margaret.  'I don't wish you to ask any such question  as that. If you had any real regard for him I  don't think you would ask it. Consider his difficulties,  and consider the position of those poor  children! If he were your brother, would you  advise him, at his age, to marry a woman without  a farthing, and also to incur the certain disgrace  which would attach to his name after — after  after all that has been said about it in this newspaper?'  — then, Lady Ball put her hand upon her  pocket; — 'in this newspaper, and in others?'

TrolAM.txt	554	1.0	1865	Trollope, Anthony,	Miss Mackenzie	It was, however, absolutely necessary that he  should do something. He was as well aware as  was Mrs. Mackenzie that it was essentially his  duty to see his cousin, now that the question of  law between them had been settled. Even if he  had no thought of again asking her to be his  wife, he could not confide to any one else the  task of telling her what" was to be her fate.  Her conduct to him in the matter of the property  had been exemplary, and it was incumbent on  him to thank her for her generous forbearance.  He had pledged himself also to give his mother  a final answer on Saturday.  On the Friday morning, therefore, he knocked  at the Mackenzies' house door in Cavendish Square,  and soon found himself alone with Mrs. Mackenzie.  I do not know that even then he had come  to any fixed purpose. What he would himself  A FRIEND IN NEED IS A FRIEND INDEED. 23l  have preferred would have been permission to  postpone any action as regarded his cousin for  another six months, and to have been empowered  to use that time in crushing Mr. Maguire out of  existence. But this might not be so, and therefore  he went to Cavendish Square that he might  there decide his fate.  'You want to see Margaret, no doubt, ' said  Mrs. Mackenzie, 'that you may tell her that her  ruin is finally completed; ' and as she thus spoke  of her cousin's ruin, she smiled her sweetest smile  and put on her pleasantest look.

I can assure you that  I have thought of it very often, — of the injustice  that has been involuntarily done to you.'  'It has been unjust, has it not?' said he, piteously,  thinking of his injuries. 'So much of it  has gone in that oilcloth business, and all for  nothing!'  'I'M glad at any rate that Walter's share did  not go.'  He knew that this was not the kind of, conversation  which he had desired to commence, and that  it must be changed before anything could  be settled. So he shook himself and began again.

Each number % Reichsmark = 70 Centimes.  OKILFUL teachers of foreign living languages, when charged with,  the instruction of advanced pupils, must feel it their duty to introduce  the young people committed to their care, not only into  the classical literature of those languages, but to give them besides  some knowledge of the writings produced in the time of today.  The present century being a period of rapid change and progress  I  ' 3' |  the number of our ideas and notions is often considerably enlarged  within the shortest space of time, and thence a continual  increase of words and terms as well as manifold alterations of  style and expression are resulting. The materials a pupil learns  from his grammar, or from reading books compiled only as many  as twenty years ago, are often, when practically used in the foreign  country, hardly sufficient for a conversation on the simplest topics.  It appears, therefore, desirable that in instructingthe upper classes,  teachers should add from time to time supplementary volumes  to the reading books already existing, and selected, for the most  part, from authors of past ages. Such supplements, taken from  the works of distinguished writers of the day, and intended to  show, as it were, an exact and striking likeness of today's speaking  and writing, are offered to the philologor in the present collection  of 'English Contemporary Authors." 
TrolAM.txt	579	0	1865	Trollope, Anthony,	Miss Mackenzie	The principles by which the editor was directed in selecting  the contents of these volumes are the following:  No long novels, but only pieces of a moderate size were  admitted, firstly, since most of the greater novels are to be got  easily and at the cheapest prices, secondly, because there appears  a greater variety of style and expression in a collection of works  written by different hands, and, thirdly, as it would be difficult  to peruse any work of greater length within the space of one  half year in a school.  With regard to the contents the preference was given to  pieces which afford useful instruction, or, when novels, to such  as are really interesting, and of the strictest morality, lest any  teacher should scruple at laying them into the hands of young  pupils of either sex.  The notes at the end of each volume entirely given in English,  are partly intended to remove difficulties lying in the subjects  themselves, and partly to explain such expressions as are  either uncommon or new, and therefore not to be found in the  smaller dictionaries.  If this collection should meet with a favourable reception, it  will be continued according to the principles adhered to by the  editor in the four numbers already published.  By a choice quality of paper and clear type, and especially  by a moderate price the introduction of these reading books  into schools will be materially facilitated. I, therefore, beg to  call the attention of teachers interested in this branch of instruction  to the present collection, offering at the same time dedicatory  copies to those who wish to make themselves better  acquainted with the plan of my undertaking.

TELL me, my dear philosophie, wise sister, why those gloomy mortals, stiled moralists, take so much pains to put us out of humour with our present state of existence, by declaring that happiness is not the lot of man, &c. &c. Do they think these dogmas enhance the value of felicity, as unexpected blessings are mostly prized? or is it that themselves, soured by mortifications and disappointments, which their vanity or caprice have occasioned, they are unwilling to acknowledge that degree of perfection, in any state of being, which they do not themselves enjoy? but why do I argue, where I can at once confute? by declaring your Emily blessed to the utmost extent of her most romantic wishes; and feeling, if possible, an addition to her felicity, by knowing that you share it.  OUR journey was delightful; even the sun, which had not appeared for some days, shone forth on us, in its full lustre: creation smiled; the gladness of my heart gilded every object; I thought the birds sung hymeneals, and I was sorry when even Miss Weston's fine voice interrupted their still sweeter notes.

LADY Harriet, who you know, is of the gentle kind, looked assent to our happiness; yet frequent sighs escaped her. Why should she sigh? I have heard people say they do so from habit, without sensibility, or sensation. Time and use may possibly work such an effect, but this habit must certainly have its rise, either from sickness, or sorrow. Perhaps lady Harriet may be in love If unhappily so, how truly to be pitied;  IT is impossible I should yet be able to give you any idea of this fine old seat, nor do I think I shall ever attempt it. I had much rather you should see than read its beauties. I hate flourishing descriptions. Modern writers over-dress nature, as ill judging women do themselves. They give her parterres for patches, hanging woods for lappets, and embroider her beautiful green gown, with all the colours of the rainbow. I flatter myself that your taste (for it is elegant) will approve whatever my lord has planned; and I shall not insist much on your admiring the works of his ancestors. The closet in which I am now writing is charmingly situated. It commands but after what I have just said, let me command my pen.

The extremes of love, surprize, resentment, joy, all operated on me.  HE was all penitence, and love; kneeled at my feet, and bathed my hand with tears; pleaded the violence of his distracted love, in excuse for the cruel letter he had wrote, when he believed me false; and uttered the most solemn vows, that it I would again receive his heart, which never had strayed one moment from me, no power on earth should ever part us more: but if I refused to accept his love, he would instantly give up the command of his ship, and retire to some part of the world, where he should never be heard of.  I WILL frankly confess, that all my tenderness for this unworthy man returned; and I even thought I loved him better than I had ever done before. He was then of age, and master of himself; there remained, therefore, nothing to oppose our wishes, for I own them mutual, but the obligations I was under, and the voluntary promise I had made to lady Anne. This objection he treated as romantic; but said, he would gratify my delicacy in this particular; and engaged to obtain her free consent.

YOUR remark upon the diversity of natures, amongst the human species, is pretty and ingenious; but when we consider the amazing variety there is in the animal creation, and how many of them are noxious, we cannot wonder that there should be some difference in human kind. Had we been all formed with equal virtues, those very virtues would have been rendered useless; an insipid tameness would have prevented emulation, and life would have become a perfect sinecure.  ON the other hand, were we all vicious, disorder and confusion must take place, and this world be quickly reduced to its primitive chaos. Without temptation, there could be no virtue; and without virtue, this world could not subsist. We should not be so much pleased with the gentleness of the lamb, if there was no animal more fierce, nor should we feel the sweetness of the woodlark's note, so sensibly as we do, if we had never heard the screech owl's voice, or the croaking of the raven. It is by comparison alone, that we are capable of estimating good and evil, both in the moral and natural sense.  I COULD illustrate my argument, as fully amongst our own species, as in the brute creation; but I have drawn this letter to such an immoderate length, that I must at least defer the remainder of my discourse, parson like, to another opportunity.  EVERY thing is settled to Lucy's mind; and lord Mount Willis's happy day is fixed for Saturday    fortnight. I hope you will come to town next week; till then,  Adieu, my ever dear Emily.

WHEN we met at dinner, she smiling asked me who the lady was that came to visit me, in the morning. I could not for some time, conceive the meaning of her question; but when from the naiveté of her discourse, I understood it, I was all confusion, and your sister lady Sandford, who was at table with us, gave me a look, that    perfectly convinced me she was acquainted with my folly.  THE inhuman marchioness must have revealed my weakness to her. Seymour could not betray his friend! Yet may I not from hence deduce a kind of tacit compliment to myself, by supposing she must have been vain of her conquest, when she proclaimed it? weak consolation! like a drowning wretch, I catch at rushes!  WHY, why can I not tear her fatal image from my breaking heart! you have seen her, Seymour? It is a thousand years since I beheld her Have age and ugliness yet overtaken her, or is she lovely still? Excuse my raving such I know it will appear to you.  I KNOW not whether I told you that lady Woodville had presented me with a son, before we left the country, and appears if possible, still more amiable in the character of a mother, than before she was one. I rejoice to think that her being a parent has added to her happiness, as well as her merit. Our virtue and our felicity are both increased, by the diffusion of our affections. What a wretch am I then, Seymour, who feel all mine concentered in one object, where they must rest for ever?

I fear that sorrow preys upon her tender heart; for from the time of our being at York, I have frequently imagined her mind was distressed; but whenever she seemed to perceive that idea rising in my thought, she has instantly banished it, by assuming an air of chearfulness and vivacity; and the transition was made with such amazing ease,    that I thought it impossible she should be insincere, and that the gloomy medium of my own reflections, and not hers, had tinctured her appearance with an air of sorrow. Can it be possible, Seymour, that a creature so young and innocent as lady Woodville, can be capable of disguising her sentiments, and hiding her grief in smiles!  I BEGIN to fear that women are our superiors in every thing. If she has perceived my passion for the marchioness, and concealed the anguish which such a discovery must occasion to a heart like hers, for well I know she fondly loves me, the story of the Spartan boy would no longer be repeated; but lady Woodville be henceforth considered as the first example of human fortitude In what a light then must her lord appear! I cannot bear the thought.

I knew not then why I should feel reluctance; but I now begin to think with you, that our presages should be listened to. Would I had hearkened then to mine! I should now be with my dearest Emily, and by sharing her anguish and fatigue, perhaps, in some degree, might lessen both but we now must feel the sad addition to our present miseries, of knowing that each other is unhappy.  ABOUT two hours before the post brought your letter to Windsor, lord Mount Willis and Sir John set out for his lordship's in Oxfordshire; and while Lucy and I were sitting at breakfast after they were gone, we heard a violent scream I knew the voice to be my little Emily's I ran up stairs to her chamber, without recollecting that she had been some time dressed, and playing with the house keeper's daughter, a child of her own age, in the garden.  LADY Mount Willis followed the sound, and found my poor little angel lying on the ground with her leg broken, the only words she spoke were "Do not let my mama be frighted," and fainted quite away.  IN this condition she was brought into the house; I will not attempt to describe mine. Your situation is by far more dreadful, yet sure it was a scene of deep distress. Suffice it now to say that the moment she is out of danger, I    will fly to share or alleviate my dearest Emily's affliction. The fond, the tender claims of child and sister, now divide my heart it almost breaks that I must say  Adieu, F. STRAFFON.

THAT which he wrote to Ransford was short, yet contained the fullest declaration, of his having fought the quarrel, and its consequences, from a weariness of life, which he said must be for ever embittered, by reflecting on the baseness of his behaviour towards lady Harriet Hanbury, as well as on the unworthy part he had acted, in seducing lady Ransford from her duty. He implored his forgiveness for the injury he committed against the honour of his family, and for having engaged him to hazard his life, from a too earnest desire of getting rid of his own.  HOW inconsistent is the conduct of this unfortunate man! his attention to the preservation of his antagonist's life, is certainly noble; but what an act of inhumanity was it to lay Ransford under the fatal necessity of becoming his executioner? or how are we to reconcile the spirit of this last action, with the unworthy te or of his former life?  I AM convinced there is no human creature so intirely lost to virtue, as not to be possessed of one good quality at least, which if known, and properly cultivated, might in some measure counterbalance its owner's vices to society; but we are all too apt to reprobate a faulty character; too indolent to search out the latent virtues of another's heart; and find it more for our ease, to take it for granted, that a vicious person must be vicious throughout, than to seek for a grain of wheat in a bushel of chaff.

Captain Beaumont presented me with his and his father's pictures; he had before given me Charlotte's portrait. Alas! it was an useless gift, as her dear image is too strongly graved on my sad heart!

ON the northern shore of Sicily are  still to be seen the magnificent  remains of a castle, which formerly belonged  to the noble house of Mazzini.  It stands in the centre of a small bay,  and upon a gentle acclivity, which, on  one side, slopes towards the sea, and on  the other rises into an eminence crowned  by dark woods. The situation is admirably  beautiful and picturesque, and  the ruins have an air of ancient grandeur,  which, contrasted with the present  solitude of the scene, impresses the  traveller with awe and curiosity. During  my travels abroad I visited this spot.  As I walked over the loose fragments    of stone, which lay scattered through  the immense area of the fabrick, and  surveyed the sublimity and grandeur of  the ruins, I recurred, by a natural association  of ideas, to the times when these  walls stood proudly in their original  splendour, when the halls were the  scenes of hospitality and festive magnificence,  and when they resounded with  the voices of those whom death had long  since swept from the earth. "Thus,  said I," shall the present generation he  who now sinks in misery and he  who now swims in pleasure, alike pass  away and be forgotten." My heart swelled  with the reflection; and, as I turned  from the scene with a sigh, I fixed  my eyes upon a friar, whose venerable  figure, gently bending towards the  earth, formed no uninteresting object in  the picture. He observed my emotion;  and, as my eye met his, shook his head  and pointed to the ruin. "These walls,"

His words  excited my curiosity, and I enquired  further concerning their meaning.  "A solemn history belongs to this  castle," said he, "which is too long and  intricate for me to relate. It is, however,  contained in a manuscript in our  library, of which, I could, perhaps, procure  you a sight. A brother of our order,  a descendant of the noble house of  Mazzini, collected and recorded the  most striking incidents relating to his  family, and the history thus formed, he  left as a legacy to our convent. If you  please, we will walk thither."  I accompanied him to the convent,  and the friar introduced me to his superior,  a man of an intelligent mind and  benevolent heart, with whom I passed  some hours in interesting conversation.  I believe my sentiments pleased him;    for by his indulgence, I was permitted  to take abstracts of the history before  me, which, with some further particulars  obtained in conversation with the  abate, I have arranged in the following  pages.      CHAPTER I.  TOWARDS the close of the sixteenth  century, this castle was in  the possession of Ferdinand, fifth marquis  of Mazzini, and was for some years  the principal residence of his family.

They stopped to observe it, when it  suddenly disappeared and was seen no  more. Madame de Menon, disturbed  at this phaenomenon, hastened into the  castle, with a view of enquiring into the  cause of it, when she was met in the  north hall by Vincent. She related to  him what she had seen, and ordered an  immediate search to be made for the  keys of those apartments. She apprehended    that some person had penetrated  that part of the edifice with an intention  of plunder; and, disdaining a paltry  fear where her duty was concerned, she  summoned the servants of the castle,  with an intention of accompanying them  thither. Vincent smiled at her apprehensions,  and imputed what she had seen  to an illusion, which the solemnity of  the hour had impressed upon her fancy.  Madame, however, persevered in her  purpose; and, after a long and repeated  search, a massey key covered with  rust was produced. She then proceeded  to the southern side of the edifice, accompanied  by Vincent, and followed  by the servants, who were agitated with  impatient wonder. The key was applied  to an iron gate, which opened  into a court that separated this division  from the other parts of the castle. They  entered this court, which was overgrown  with grass and weeds, and ascended  some steps that led to a large door,    which they vainly endeavoured to open.

Julia, almost  fainting, gave her hand to Ferdinand;  and Hippolitus, after some short expression  of his thankfulness, followed. They  passed the door of Madame's chamber;    and treading the gallery with slow and  silent steps, descended to the hall. This  they crossed towards a door, after opening  which they were to find their way  through various passages to a remote  part of the castle, where a private door  opened upon the walls. Ferdinand carried  the several keys. They fastened  the hall door after them, and proceeded  through a narrow passage terminating in  a stair-case.  They descended, and had hardly  reached the bottom, when they heard a  loud noise at the door above, and presently  the voices of several people. Julia  scarcely felt the ground she trod  on, and Ferdinand slew to unlock a  door that obstructed their way. He  applied the different keys, and at length  found the proper one, but the lock  was rusted, and refused to yield. Their  distress now was not to be conceived.

What  evil spirits infest these walls?  Henceforth be cautions how ye credit  the phantasms of idleness, for ye may  not always meet with a master who  will condescend to undeceive ye." They  acknowledged the goodness of the marquis,  and professing themselves perfectly  conscious of the error of their  former suspicions, desired they might  search no farther. "I chuse to leave  nothing to your imagination," replied    the marquis, lest hereafter it should betray  you into a similar error. Follow  me, therefore; you shall see the whole  of these buildings." Saying this he  led them to the south tower. They remembered,  that from a door of this  tower, the figure which caused their  alarm had issued; and notwithstanding  the late assertion of their suspicions  being removed, fear still operated powerfully  upon their minds, and they  would willingly have been excused  from farther research. "Would any  of you chuse to explore this tower?"  said the marquis, pointing to the broken  stair-case; "for myself I am mortal,  and therefore fear to venture, but  you who hold communion with disembodied  spirits, may partake something  of their nature, if so, you may pass without  apprehension where the ghost has  probably passed before." They shrunk  at this reproof, and were silent.  The marquis, turning to a door on    his right hand, ordered it to be unlocked.

She was ordered to confine  herself to her apartment till her innocence  should be cleared, or her sister  discovered. From Madame de Menon  she received a faithful sympathy, which  was the sole relief of her oppressed  heart. Her anxiety concerning Julia  daily encreased, and was heightened  into the most terrifying apprehensions  for her safety. She knew of no person  in whom her sister could confide, or of    any place where she could find protection;  the most deplorable evils were  therefore to be expected.  One day as she was sitting at the window  of her apartment, engaged in melancholy  reflection, she saw a man riding  towards the castle on full speed.  Her heart beat with fear and expectation,  for his haste made her suspect he  brought intelligence of Julia, and she  could scarcely refrain from breaking  through the command of the marquis,  and rushing into the hall to learn something  of his errand. She was right in  her conjecture; the person she had seen  was a spy of the marquis's, and came to  inform him that the lady Julia was at that  time concealed in a cottage of the forest  of Marentino. The marquis rejoiced  at this intelligence, and gave the man a  liberal reward. He learned also, that  she was accompanied by a young cavalier,  which circumstance surprized him  exceedingly, for he knew of no person    except the count de Vereza with whom  she could have entrusted herself, and  the count had fallen by his sword! He  immediately ordered a party of his people  to accompany the messenger to the  forest of Marentino, and to suffer neither  Julia nor the cavalier to escape  them on pain of death.

Having dispatched an hasty meal,  they again set forward in the way  pointed out to them as the route of the  fugitives. The country assumed a more  civilized aspect. Corn, vineyards, olives,  and groves of mulberry trees adorned  the hills. The vallies, luxuriant in  shade, were frequently embellished by  the windings of a lucid stream, and diversified  by clusters of half-seen cottages.  Here the rising turrets of a monastery  appeared above the thick trees  with which they were surrounded; and  there the savage wilds, the travellers  had passed, formed a bold and picturesque  back-ground to the scene.  To the questions put by the duke to  the several persons he met, he received  answers that encouraged him to proceed.  At noon he halted at a village to  refresh himself and his people. He    could gain no intelligence of Julia, and  was perplexed which way to chuse;  but determined at length to pursue the  road he was then in, and accordingly  again set forward. He travelled several  miles without meeting any person  who could give the necessary information,  and began to despair of success.

He then assured them, that  since indulgence had only encouraged  intrusion, he would for the future be severe;    vere; and concluded with declaring, that  the first man who should disturb him  with a repetition of such ridiculous apprehensions,  or should attempt to disturb  the peace of the castle by circulating  these idle notions, should be rigorously  punished, and banished his dominions.  They shrunk back at this  reproof, and were silent. "Bring a  torch," said the marquis, "and shew  me to the dungeon. I will once more  condescend to confute you."  They obeyed, and descended with  the marquis, who, arriving at the dungeon,  instantly threw open the door,  and discovered to the astonished eyes of  his attendants Ferdinand! He started  with surprize at the entrance of his  father thus attended. The marquis  darting upon him a severe look, which  he perfectly comprehended "Now,"  cried he, turning to his people, "what  do you see? My son, whom I myself  placed here, and whose voice, which    answered to your calls, you have transformed  into unknown sounds. "Speak,  Ferdinand, and confirm what I say."  Ferdinand did so. "What dreadful  spectre appeared to you last night? Resumed  the marquis, looking stedfastly  upon him: gratify these fellows with a  description of it, for they cannot exist  without something of the marvelous."  "None my lord," replied Ferdinand,  who too well understood the manner of  the marquis. "Tis well," cried the  marquis, "and this is the last time,"  turning to his attendants, "that your  folly shall be treated with so much lenity."

She now opened the door, and to her  inexpressible astonishment and distress,  found the cottage empty. She proceeded  to a small inner room, where lay  a part of Julia's apparel. The bed had no  appearance of having been slept in, and  every moment served to heighten and  confirm her apprehensions. While she  pursued the search, she suddenly heard  the trampling of feet at the cottage door,  and presently after some people entered.  Her fears for Julia now yielded to those  for her own safety, and she was undetermined    whether to discover herself, or  remain in her present situation, when  she was relieved from her irresolution  and distress by the appearance of Julia.  On the return of the good woman,  who had accompanied Madame to the  village on the preceding night, Julia went  to the cottage at Farrini. Her grateful  heart would not suffer her to depart  without taking leave of her faithful  friends, thanking them for their kindness,  and informing them of her future  prospects. They had prevailed upon  her to spend the few intervening hours  at this cot, whence she had just risen  to meet Madame.  They now hastened to the spot where  the horses were stationed,and commenced  their journey. For some leagues they  travelled in silence and thought, over  a wild and picturesque country. The  landscape was tinted with rich and variegated  hues; and the autumnal lights,  which streamed upon the hills, produced    a spirited and beautiful effect upon the  scenery. All the glories of the vintage  rose to their view: the purple  grapes flushed through the dark green of  the surrounding foliage, and the prospect  glowed with warm luxuriance.

"Of the life which your care has    prolonged," said she, "it is but just  that you should know the events;  though those events are neither new,  or striking, and possess little power  of interesting persons unconnected with  them. To me they have, however,  been unexpectedly dreadful in effect,  and my heart assures me, that to you  they will not be indifferent."  "I am the unfortunate descendant of  an ancient and illustrious Italian family.  In early childhood I was deprived of a  mother's care, but the tenderness of my  surviving parent made her loss, as to my  welfare, almost unfelt. Suffer me here  to do justice to the character of my noble  father. He united in an eminent  degree, the mild virtues of social life,  with the firm unbending qualities of the  noble Romans, his ancesters, from whom  he was proud to trace his descent. Their  merit, indeed, continually dwelt on his  tongue, and their actions he was always  endeavouring to imitate, as far as was    consistent with the character of his times,  and with the limited sphere in which he  moved. The recollection of his virtue  elevates my mind, and fills my heart  with a noble pride, which even the cold  walls of a monastery have not been able  to subdue.  My father's fortune was unsuitable to  his rank. That his son might hereafter  be enabled to support the dignity of his  family, it was necessary for me to assume  the veil. Alas! that heart was unfit to  be offered at an heavenly shrine, which  was already devoted to an earthly object.

His countenance  was pale with anger, and he was  pacing the room with slow but agitated  steps. The stern authority of his look  startled her. "Read this letter," said  he, stretching forth his hand which  held a letter, "and tell me what that  mortal deserves, who dares insult our  holy order, and set our sacred prerogative  at defiance." Madame distinguished  the hand writing of the marquis, and  the words of the Superior threw her into  the utmost astonishment. She took the    letter. It was dictated by that spirit of  proud vindictive rage, which so strongly  marked the character of the marquis.  Having discovered the retreat of Julia,  and believing the monastery afforded  her a willing sanctuary from his pursuit,  he accused the Abate of encouraging  his child in open rebellion to his  will. He loaded him and his sacred  order with opprobrium, and threatened,  if she was not immediately resigned to  the emissaries in waiting, he would in  person lead on a force which should  compel the church to yield to the superior  authority of the father.  The spirit of the Abate was roused by  this menace; and Julia obtained from  his pride, that protection which neither  his principle nor his humanity would  have granted. "The man shall tremble,"  cried he,"who dares defy our power,  or question our sacred authority.  The lady Julia is safe. I will protect  her from this proud invader of our    rights, and teach him at least to venerate  the power he cannot conquer. I  have dispatched his emissaries with my  answer."

What punishment is adequate  to guilt like this?"    The father paused his eyes sternly  fixed on Julia, who pale and trembling,  could scarcely support herself, and who  had no power to reply. "I will be  merciful, and not just," resumed he, "I  will soften the punishment you deserve,  and will only deliver you to your  father." At these dreadful words, Julia  bursting into tears, sunk at the feet of  the Abate, to whom she raised her eyes  in supplicating expression, but was  unable to speak. He suffered her to  remain in this posture. "Your duplicity,"  he resumed, "is not the least of  your offences. Had you relied upon  our generosity for forgiveness and protection,  an indulgence might have been  granted; but under the disguise of  virtue you concealed your crimes, and  your necessities were hid beneath the  mask of devotion."  These false aspersions roused in Julia  the spirit of indignant virtue; she arose  from her knees with an air of dignity,    that struck even the Abate. "Holy father,"  said she, "my heart abhors the  crime you mention, and disclaims all  union with it. Whatever are my offences from  the sin of hypocrisy I am at  least free; and you will pardon me if I  remind you, that my confidence has already  been such, as fully justifies my  claim to the protection I solicit. When  I sheltered myself within these walls, it  was to be presumed that they would  protect me from injustice; and with  what other term than injustice would  you, Sir, distinguish the conduct of  the marquis, if the fear of his power  did not overcome the dictates of truth?"

Her lover sinking back, endeavoured  to conceal his emotions, but the deep  sobs which agitated his breast, betrayed  his anguish, and the tears of every spectator  bedewed the sacred spot where  beauty, sense, and innocence expired.  The organ now swelled in mournful  harmony; and the voices of the assembly  chanted in choral strain, a low and solemn  requiem to the spirit of the departed.  Madame hurried Julia, who was almost  as lifeless as her departed friend,  from the church. A death so sudden,  heightened the grief which separation    would otherwise have occasioned.  It was the nature of Cornelia's disorder,  to wear a changeful but flattering aspect.  Though she had long been declining,  her decay was so gradual and  imperceptible, as to lull the apprehensions  of her friends into security.  It was otherwise with herself; she was conscious  of the change, but forbore to afflict  them with the knowledge of the truth.  The hour of her dissolution was sudden,  even to herself; but it was composed,  and even happy. In the death of Cornelia  Julia seemed to mourn again that  of Hippolitus. Her decease appeared  to dissolve the last tie which connected  her with his memory.  In one of the friars of the convent,  Madame was surprized to find the father  who had confessed the dying Vincent.

At length the tumult began to subside,  and Hippolitus could distinguish  what was said. The ruffians agreed to  give up the lady in question to him who    had fought for her; and leaving him to  his prize, they all went out in quest of  farther prey. The situation of the unfortunate  lady excited a mixture of pity  and indignation in Hippolitus, which  for some time entirely occupied him;  he revolved the means of extricating  her from so deplorable a situation, and  in these thoughts almost forgot his own  danger. He now heard her sighs; and  while his heart melted to the sounds, the  farther door of the apartment was thrown  open, and the wretch to whom she had  been allotted, rushed in. Her screams  now redoubled, but they were of no  avail with the ruffian who had seized  her in his arms; when the count, who  was unarmed, insensible to every impulse  but that of a generous pity, burst  into the room, but became fixed like a  statue when he beheld his Julia struggling  in the grasp of the ruffian. On  discovering Hippolitus, she made a sudden  spring, and liberated herself; when,    running to him, she sunk lifeless in his  arms.  Surprize and fury sparkled in the eyes  of the ruffian, and he turned with a savage  desperation upon the count; who,  relinquishing Julia, snatched up the  sword of the dead ruffian, which lay  upon the floor, and defended himself.

On the following morning Ferdinand  returned with his friends to Palermo,  where he first disclosed the late fatal  events of the castle. They now settled  their future plans; and Ferdinand hastened  to the castle of Mazzini to fetch  Emilia, and to give orders for the removal  of his household to his palace at  Naples, where he designed to fix his future  residence. The distress of Emilia,  whom he found recovered from her indisposition,  yielded to joy and wonder,  when she heard of the existence of her  mother, and the safety of her sister.  She departed with Ferdinand for Palermo,  where her friends awaited her, and  where the joy of the meeting was considerably  heightened by the appearance    of Madame de Menon, for whom the  marchioness had dispatched a messenger  to St. Augustin's. Madame had quitted  the abbey for another convent, to  which however the messenger was directed.  This happy party now embarked  for Naples.  From this period the castle of Mazzini,  which had been the theatre of a  dreadful catastrophe, and whose scenes  would have revived in the minds of the  chief personages connected with it,  painful and shocking recollections was  abandoned.  On their arrival at Naples, Ferdinand  presented to the king a clear and satisfactory  account of the late events at the  castle, in consequence of which the marchioness  was confirmed in her rank, and  Ferdinand was received as the sixth marquis  de Mazzini.

The marchioness, thus restored to  the world, and to happiness, resided  with her children in the palace at Naples,  where, after time had somewhat    mellowed the remembrance of the late  calamity, the nuptials of Hippolitus and  Julia were celebrated. The recollection  of the difficulties they had encountered,  and of the distress they had endured  for each other, now served only  to heighten by contrast the happiness of  the present period.  Ferdinand soon after accepted a command  in the Neapolitan army; and  amidst the many heroes of that warlike  and turbulent age, distinguished himself  for his valour and ability. The  occupations of war engaged his mind,  while his heart was occupied in promoting  the happiness of his family.  Madame de Menon, whose generous  attachment to the marchioness had been  fully proved, found in the restoration of  her friend a living witness of her marriage,  and thus recovered those estates  which had been unjustly with-held from  her. But the marchioness and her family,  grateful to her friendship, and attached    to her virtues, prevailed upon  her to spend the remainder of her life  at the palace of Mazzini.  Emilia, wholly attached to her family,  continued to reside with the marchioness,  who saw her race renewed in  the children of Hippolitus and Julia.  Thus surrounded by her children and  friends, and engaged in forming the  minds of the infant generation, she  seemed to forget that she had ever been  otherwise than happy."  Here the manuscript annals conclude.  In reviewing this story, we perceive a  singular and striking instance of moral  retribution. We learn also, that those  who do only THAT WHICH IS  RIGHT, endure nothing in misfortune  but a trial of their virtue, and from trials  well endured, derive the surest claim to  the protection of heaven.

What memories does this beloved  name awaken in my heart! — what associations recall from  the recesses of the long buried past!  Now, while these memories and associations are fresh in  my mind, wilt come with me, dear reader, to this sweet spot?  wilt recline 'neath the sheltering branches of these noble  trees? wilt place thy hand cordially in mine, and lend me  thy sympathy and thy heart? and, while the birds are warbling  their love songs over thy head, and the rainbow tinted  fountain dashes its delicate and cooling spray about thy feet,  — while the fleecy clouds rest lightly in the southern heavens,  and the distant hum of the busy city, together with the far  off murmuring of waters, lull thy senses to forgetfulness of  care, — wilt listen to my simple tale?  1*  6 BOSTON COMMON.  I was born in a little country village, not many hundred  miles from the city of Boston. It is due to my parents to  say something of them in this place. My father was an  Englishman, of a proud old stock, who came from the county  of Kent, England, to this country, many years before my  birth. His father sent him to college, when quite young, to  acquire a thorough classical education. He was destined for  the bar; but, happening to meet with a pretty young lady  soon after his entrance, he became unfortunately enamoured of  her. I say unfortunately; for she had, in the eyes of the  world, the great fault of being very poor in purse, although  exceedingly beautiful in person. 
FarrBC.txt	1	30240.0	1856	Farren, Mrs	Boston Common	The young gentleman wrote to his papa in due time, entreating  his permission to wed the fair Helen, and thereby  make two loving hearts one.  This tender epistle brought the old gentleman down very  quickly to ascertain whom his darling Willie intended for the  high honour of his hand; but when he found that the lady in  question was a little nobody, who cut and made dresses for  the proud dames of the village whenever they chose to patronise  her, his rage knew no bounds. Ho anathematized her  at once ; called her a " saucy young baggage, " a " presuming  upstart, " c.; and, shaking his gold headed cane in the very  face of Master William, bade him attend to his studies immediately,  and to beware how he fell in love or troubled his  father with such fooleries again.  My grandfather then departed, in high good-humour with  himself, thinking he had nipped a glorious rebellion in the  bud, and conquered a young madcap of a son, who he forgot  had the same unconquerable blood in his veins that flowed  BOSTON COMMON. 7  through his own, and only waiting an occasion like the present  to boil over.  Young William was highly incensed at the insult, as ho  called it, that his father had put upon him and his ladye love,  and, with the fury and impetuosity of eighteen, flew to Helen's  humble dwelling, and informed her, in glowing terms, of his  father's language and resolution. 
FarrBC.txt	40	2160.0	1856	Farren, Mrs	Boston Common	Hettie saw the immediate necessity of doing something; so,  arising, she dried her eyes, and was soon, with her sister's help,  dressed, and in the presence of her intended husband.  " My dearest Miss Graham, " said the gentleman, coming  forward to meet her, and leading her to a seat, " how very  happy I am to see you looking so well! I trembled, all the  way, for fear you might be ill, or something." He then, in low  and thrilling language, poured into her ear the tale of his  love, and ended by saying that she should be a second  Helen to him, and that he would cherish and love her as  fondly as ever man loved woman.  Hettie was fascinated by the tones of the gentleman. His  language, the first of the kind she had ever listened to, seemed  like some beautiful music welling up from his heart; and,  pleased as a child with toys at the novelty of her situation,  she yielded a willing consent.  The morrow's sun ushered in as bright and beautiful a day  as one would wish to see. At ten o'clock precisely, the bride  ' elect, dressed in her rich robes and looking charmingly beautiful,  was handed into the carriage by her enamoured lover.  Accompanied by her sister and a young gentleman acquaintance,  they rode out to a little country village and were married.  They returned, as spon as the ceremony was over, to a  BOSTON COMMON. .45  large dinner party which the good mother had assembled  while they were absent. 
FarrBC.txt	73	20160.0	1856	Farren, Mrs	Boston Common	"Helen, " said my mother, one morning, soon after my  return home, " what is the matter with you since you came  back? Are you still sick, or do you wish to return, and see  some one whom you left in Bardville? Come, cheer up,  child, or I shall think you are in love; and I should feel sad  enough to see you pining away on that account."  These words — said half in earnest, half in jest — set mo  to thinking, and I did not wonder that my mother spoke of  my appearance. I knew that I felt listless and unhappy,  and must appear so. Even Kate Merton had noticed the  change in me, without being able to account for it, for I  guarded my half fledged love even from her friendly eyes. I  therefore determined to conceal my feelings hereafter, and to  assume my accustomed cheerfulness, and be as gay as possible.  So I schooled my heart to obedience, dressed my face  in smiles, and with my old appearance of happiness, soon put  all suspicions at rest.  About a fortnight after my return home, I one day received  a letter from my lady friend in. Bardville. How  eagerly did I grasp the little missive, and how dear did it  seem to me, for it had come from the home of Roland! I  broke the seal hastily, and ran my eyes carelessly over the  7  74 BOSTON COMMON. . 
FarrBC.txt	76	6307200.0	1856	Farren, Mrs	Boston Common	Her words conveyed both pleasure and pain to me; pleasure,  that he, my heart's idol, had indeed come to live with  us, and pain, that another should couple her name with his in  that manner. I left her at her door, and pursued my way  home, wondering what could have induced Hastings to come  to Linden, and what could be his business here. I passed an  almost sleepless night, and arose the next morning filled with  happiness ; for the thought that he was going to live in Lin  76 BOSTON COMMON.  den because it was my home, had taken entire possession of  my mind, and was far too pleasing to be lightly rejected.  As soon as breakfast was over, I sought Mary Listen, my  friend of the day before, in the hope of gaining more information  from her concerning Hastings. She soon began to  speak of him, and, after expatiating a while upon his "wondrous  beauty', " his " floating hair, soul subduing eyes, " c.,  told me that he bad come to Linden for the purpose of going  into business with a gentleman. I saw that Mary was very  much interested in the young man, but it did not cause me  much trouble, for I folt quite willing to match my advantages  with hers, any day. Poor Mary, how sad a fate was  thine ! Thy memory comes to me through the long vista of  years that have passed since thy death, and a sadness at thy  untimely end creeps over my heart, and fills my eyes with  tears of regret. Mary loved, and, not meeting with a return  of love from the beloved object, faded away, and died brokenhearted. 
FarrBC.txt	136	2.0	1856	Farren, Mrs	Boston Common	" 0, Helen, " said Mr. Moore, " speak to me! — tell me you  love me ! — say you did not think that I could place my affections  upon that brainless, lovesick girl ? "  " Sir, " I replied, " I do not love you, and never shall do  more than respect you; and as for your calling my dear  Letitia brainless, and all that, let me tell you, sir, that she is  very far from being brainless; and, if she is lovesick, sir,  who has made her so but yourself? I am astonished, sir,  that, knowing, as you must do, her preference for you, you  can thus declare your love for another, and that other her  intimate friend!"  Elwyn Moore turned, and gave me such a reproachful look  as made my heart grow sick. " I thank you, Miss Clifton, "  128 BOSTON COMMON.  laid be, " for your attention thus far. How much I regret  your decision, I will not, dare not, say. Time alone will tell  how much I suffer. I 'll not trouble you with it; but, my  dear young lady, as for Letitia Milford, you need give yourself  no uneasiness concerning her. She will outlive a dozen  such ones as you or myself; and, after falling in love with  every one who crosses her path, will at last settle down into  a commonplace, sensible woman, with one, perhaps, whom  she really loves." 
FarrBC.txt	161	2.0	1856	Farren, Mrs	Boston Common	" I cannot tell you, Harry, " I answered. " Suffice it to  say that, since yesterday morning, a deep, a withering grief  has laid hold upon me, and is gnawing, with its vulture teeth,  my very heartstrings away; and that since that time I have  lived years, and that I must have relief; and I SSne to you  to give it me, or to direct me where I may obtain it."  Harry mused a moment; then, looking at my pale and  weary face, an expression of pain flitted over his own features.  " Have you been at your devotions lately, Helen ?"  he asked.  " No, Harry, " answered I, blushing. " Since you talked  with me, I have been absorbed in.my own selfish feelings,  and am still, although ashamed to own it."  He looked down a moment, as if musing. "If I only  knew your sorrow, Helen, " he said, " I would strive to ameliorate  it."  " My grief admits of no amelioration, " I replied. " It  lies too deep for mortal aid to reach; but consolation I must  have, and immediately, or I will die."  " Say not so, Helen, " answered my cousin. " Do not talk  of dying, unless by God's holy will. Remember that He  placed you here, and for his own purpose ; and if he afflicts  you, it is that you may be brought nearer to him, and that  you may seek comfort from him. Is it not so?" 
FarrBC.txt	215	2.0	1856	Farren, Mrs	Boston Common	" Helena, darling, I love once more! and this time no snivelling  schoolmaster, who cannot appreciate the rich treasure  of a woman's love; but a tall, slender youth, of wild, glorious  beauty; eyes that took captive my silly maiden heart at  once; and hair like the ambrosial locks of the gods, — golden,  and floating in curls over an intellectual brow; and then,  his name — why, it is so sweet, so musical, that I half lost my  breath when I first heard it spoken! Listen, Helena, mine  own, while I breathe it — Clarence Brook! Didst ever  hear anything half so beautiful? It reminds me of the  murmuring of brooks or the warbling of birds in summertime.  It fell upon my enraptured ear like rich musie, and  vibrated among my heartstrings long after I had heard it  spoken!  " Clarence Brook (I love to repeat the sweet name) is the  196 BOSTON COMMON.  son of a wealthy gentleman, who has sent him here to complete  his education, preparatory to entering college, — and  such an addition as he is to our little cherished circle! But,  0, sad to relate, my sweetest Helena! he scorns my devoted  love ; he deigns not to cast one pitying glance upon my bleeding  heart, — bleeding but for him alone ! But time will tell  the tale. Should Clarence still continue cold, and regardless  of my deep affection, I shall sink at his feet, and expire,  breathing out his name with my last respiration. 
FarrBC.txt	231	1152.0	1856	Farren, Mrs	Boston Common	After many hours spent in a tumult of bitter feelings, I  arose and dragged my weary frame to my chamber, where I  sought my couch, and endeavoured to tranquillize my feelings  by sleep.  CHAPTER XXII.  " Through the heart  Should jealousy its venom once diffuse,  * * * * ye fairy prospects, then,  Yo beds of roses, and ye bowers of joy,  Farewell; yo gleamings of departed peace,  Shine out your last the yellow, tinging plague;  Internal vision taints, and in a night  Of livid gloom Imagination wraps."  Thomson.  I awoke in the morning with an aching brow, and a painful  sense of tightness about my chest, which increased to  such a degree that a physician was called in before noon to  administer relief. He shook his head, however, when he had  examined my pulse, and, saying that my mind was troubled,  left, without giving me any medicine.  My uncle and aunt then sought my couch, and desired me  to explain to them the cause of my illness. As their desires  were commands with me, which I dared not disobey, I told  them, in a choking voice, that I had the night before  pledged myself to become the wife of Ernest Richmond;  that I loved him not, but had been forced by him to make  this promise.  My kind friends were delighted! They embraced me very  18*  210 BOSTON COMMON.  tenderly, and wished me all sorts of happiness, saying that I  had fulfilled the darling wish of their hearts; that nothing  could have given them greater pleasure; and that I was  their own sensible child, after all! 
FarrBC.txt	298	1.9	1856	Farren, Mrs	Boston Common	Every word that Ernest uttered sank deep into my heart.  I saw and appreciated at once his lofty, self-denying spirit. I  was spellbound with admiration of the noble being, who stood,  in all the beauty and glory of his manly strength, and pleaded so  earnestly for his God. The remembrance of Roland, however,  and his pale sad face, also my solemn vow of the evening before,  rose in startling colours before me, and I found strength to reply.  " Ernest, " said I, " I cannot sign that paper; but I will  sign one giving you my fortune, if you wish, for the purposes  you have mentioned; but I cannot be your wife, for I am  promised to another! "  I stopped, for my companion had arisen, and was gazing  upon me with surprise. He made no comment, however,  upon my last words, but said, with coldness and asperity,  268 BOSTON COMMON.  " Very well, Helen, you are at liberty to follow your own  inclinations. I cannot bear to give you up, but, as you sincerely  wish it, I release you for a while — remember, only for  a while. I give yon, with all your wealth, youth, and talents,  to Roland Hastings; but I foresee a bitter awakening for you. 
FarrBC.txt	366	1440.0	1856	Farren, Mrs	Boston Common	Kate was delighted with the Common. She gazed with  admiration at the lofty trees, and was never weary of wandering  through the shady paths, or of watching the beautiful  fountain, as it fell, with many graceful evolutions, to the basin  of the pond, or dashed its cool, rainbow coloured spray about  our feet.  At length we found ourselves at home once more, and,  wearied with our long journey, were not sorry for the opportunity  of resting a while. Letitia was quite overjoyed to  28  BOSTON COMMON.  see us again, and went into some of her old raptures over us ;  which I overlooked on this occasion, and, kissing the little  Helen, who had grown very finely, expressed my pleasure in  seeing them both looking so well and happy.  " 0 yes, Helen, " said Mrs. Roscoe, " I am perfectly content,  and shall be delighted to spend my life with you in this  dear retreat; for I have found that peace and comfort here  which it was impossible to obtain elsewhere."  And so it seemed; for Letitia did not trouble herself much  about anything beyond her chamber. She busied herself in  taking care of her child, to whom she seemed exceedingly  attached, and in reading a parcel of novels she had brought  from the Alleghanies.

" Not the last sounding oould surprise me more,  That summons drowsy mortals to their doom."  DBYDEN.  I NOW felt almost happy. I hung over my husband with  joy. I combed his beautiful hair. I seated myself at his  feet, and, laying my head in his lap, talked to him of the  blessings we still possessed in our beautiful home, our noble  boy, and in our love for each other. I was afraid of saying  a word which might cause him to repent the new step he  had taken, and so I never reverted to the past.  I told him stories of men who had conquered themselves,  who had learned to rule their own spirits, who had struggled  with mighty temptations and come out victorious. And then  our conversations would revert to Willie, and we would  resolve to set an example of purity and goodness before our  child, to guard him from evil, and to inculcate lessons of virtue  into his heart.  He listened to all these stories, and agreed with me concerning  the child. I could not have believed that I should  have felt so much consolation. I was surprised to find my  burden BO much lighter, and blessed God for his kindness  to me.  32  874 BOSTON COMMON.

" O,  Mr. Merriman, " said I, in a voice of agony, " my child is very  ill, perhaps dying ! — go at once, and without a question, for  the doctor. Tell him to come, and to come instantly. Do  not delay; but go, in Heaven's name ! "  " And you ? " he said, anxiously.  " Never mind me, but go immediately, " said I.  Mr. Merriman had a kind heart; and, turning to a large,  red faced man, he said,  " Mr. Douglas, take care of this lady until I return ; and  do not let her venture out of doors alone, by any means, for  she will surely perish. I will see her safely home, when I  come from the doctor's."  " Mr. Douglas ! " thought I; " then where ami? 0,1 see,  — in the miserable den where my husband spends his time  and money!"  The man approached me. " My friend, " said he, " will you  have a chair, and something warm to take ? "  His words were kind, but a suddden gush of feeling came  over me at the word " friend ; " — calling me, whom he had  caused so much suffering, by such an endearing title! I  turned slowly towards him. A deep sense of the injuries  which ho had inflicted upon me filled my bosom almost to  bursting. I felt my quick, passionate temper, which Ernest.

" And a delightful companion — handsome, agreeable, c "  " do not know, " answered Kate, as she made a very large  " R, " uncommonly black, I thought.  " You do not know ? I wonder who does, if you do not.  You have tested his companionship by the hour together ;  and one would suppose you thought it the best in the world,  for you seem to be entirely absorbed in what he is saying, —  so much so, that you have no time to attend even to my simple  wants and requests."  " 0, Helen ! how can you ? "  " It's a fact. For instance: last evening you sat in a  corner of the sofa with him more than two hours. Ernest,  Edward, and Mabel, had gone out; Willie was asleep ; and  there sat your cherished friend Helen, with not a soul to  speak to, for those long, long hours.  " Well, I bore it as long as I could, and then resolved,  lover or no lover, boldly to stand up for my own rights. With  all my bravery, however, my resolution failed me as I approached  the sofa. After considering a moment, as all wise  people do, I plucked up the courage to speak. ' My dear  Katherine, ' said I, in the sweetest of voices, ' will you lend  me your Henriade a. few moments ?' My words were very  soft, and my request quite modest; but I might as well have  BOSTON COMMON. 485  spoken to the winds, for you paid not the slightest heed to  me. I repeated my question; but still you heard me not. I  then thought of some other plan; so I turned, suddenly, and  tipped over a chair at the other corner of the room. Fearing  for my rashness, however, I immediately darted behind the  window curtain. This experiment was as unlucky as the other.

thebigsleep.txt	0	1.0	1939	Chandler, Raymond	The Big Sleep	ONE    It was about eleven o’clock in the morning, mid October, with the sun not shining and a look of hard wet rain in the clearness of the foothills. I was wearing my powder-blue suit, with dark blue shirt, tie and display handkerchief, black brogues, black wool socks with dark blue clocks on them. I was neat, clean, shaved and sober, and I didn’t care who knew it. I was everything the well-dressed private detective ought to be. I was calling on four million dollars.    The main hallway of the Sternwood place was two stories high. Over the entrance doors, which would have let in a troop of Indian elephants, there was a broad stained-glass panel showing a knight in dark armor rescuing a lady who was tied to a tree and didn’t have any clothes on but some very long and convenient hair. The knight had pushed the vizor of his helmet back to be sociable, and he was fiddling with the knots on the ropes that tied the lady to the tree and not getting anywhere. I stood there and thought that if I lived in the house, I would sooner or later have to climb up there and help him. He didn’t seem to be really trying. 
thebigsleep.txt	1	1.0	1939	Chandler, Raymond	The Big Sleep	  There were French doors at the back of the hall, beyond them a wide sweep of emerald grass to a white garage, in front of which a slim dark young chauffeur in shiny black leggings was dusting a maroon Packard convertible. Beyond the garage were some decorative trees trimmed as carefully as poodle dogs. Beyond them a large greenhouse with a domed roof. Then more trees and beyond everything the solid, uneven, comfortable line of the foothills.    On the east side of the hall a free staircase, tile-paved, rose to a gallery with a wrought-iron railing and another piece of stained-glass romance. Large hard chairs with rounded red plush seats were backed into the vacant spaces of the wall round about. They didn’t look as if anybody had ever sat in them. In the middle of the west wall there was a big empty fireplace with a brass screen in four hinged panels, and over the fireplace a marble mantel with cupids at the corners. Above the mantel there was a large oil portrait, and above the portrait two bullet-torn or moth-eaten cavalry pennants crossed in a glass frame. The portrait was a stiffly posed job of an officer in full regimentals of about the time of the Mexican war. The officer had a neat black imperial, black mustachios, hot hard coal-black eyes, and the general look of a man it would pay to get along with. I thought this might be General Sternwood’s grandfather. It could hardly be the General himself, even though I had heard he was pretty far gone in years to have a couple of daughters still in the dangerous twenties.

He just looked at me lifelessly. The butler pushed a damp wicker chair against the backs of my legs and I sat down. He took my hat with a deft scoop.    Then the old man dragged his voice up from the bottom of a well and said: “Brandy, Norris. How do you like your brandy, sir?”    “Any way at all,” I said.    The butler went away among the abominable plants. The General spoke again, slowly, using his strength as carefully as an out-of-work show-girl uses her last good pair of stockings.    “I used to like mine with champagne. The champagne as cold as Valley Forge and about a third of a glass of brandy beneath it. You may take your coat off, sir. It’s too hot in here for a man with blood in his veins.”    I stood up and peeled off my coat and got a handkerchief out and mopped my face and neck and the backs of my wrists. St. Louis in August had nothing on that place. I sat down again and I felt automatically for a cigarette and then stopped. The old man caught the gesture and smiled faintly.    “You may smoke, sir. I like the smell of tobacco.”    I lit the cigarette and blew a lungful at him and he sniffed at it like a terrier at a rathole. The faint smile pulled at the shadowed corners of his mouth.

She took a swallow from it and gave me a cool level stare over the rim of the glass.    “So you’re a private detective,” she said. “I didn’t know they really existed, except in books. Or else they were greasy little men snooping around hotels.”    There was nothing in that for me, so I let it drift with the current. She put her glass down on the flat arm of the chaise-longue and flashed an emerald and touched her hair. She said slowly: “How did you like Dad?”    “I liked him,” I said.    “He liked Rusty. I suppose you know who Rusty is?”    “Uh-huh.”    “Rusty was earthy and vulgar at times, but he was very real. And he was a lot of fun for Dad. Rusty shouldn’t have gone off like that. Dad feels very badly about it, although he won’t say so. Or did he?”    “He said something about it.”    “You’re not much of a gusher, are you, Mr. Marlowe? But he wants to find him, doesn’t he?”    I stared at her politely through a pause. “Yes and no,” I said. 
thebigsleep.txt	22	1.0	1939	Chandler, Raymond	The Big Sleep	          FOUR    A. G. Geiger’s place was a store frontage on the north side of the boulevard near Las Palmas. The entrance door was set far back in the middle and there was a copper trim on the windows, which were backed with Chinese screens, so I couldn’t see into the store. There was a lot of oriental junk in the windows. I didn’t know whether it was any good, not being a collector of antiques, except unpaid bills. The entrance door was plate glass, but I couldn’t see much through that either, because the store was very dim. A building entrance adjoined it on one side and on the other was a glittering credit jewelry establishment. The jeweler stood in his entrance, teetering on his heels and looking bored, a tall handsome white-haired Jew in lean dark clothes, with about nine carats of diamond on his right hand. A faint knowing smile curved his lips when I turned into Geiger’s store. I let the door close softly behind me and walked on a thick blue rug that paved the floor from wall to wall. There were blue leather easy chairs with smoke stands beside them. A few sets of tooled leather bindings were set out on narrow polished tables, between book ends. There were more tooled bindings in glass cases on the walls. Nice-looking merchandise, the kind a rich promoter would buy by the yard and have somebody paste his bookplate in. At the back there was a grained wood partition with a door in the middle of it, shut. In the corner made by the partition and one wall a woman sat behind a small desk with a carved wooden lantern on it. 
thebigsleep.txt	83	3.0	1939	Chandler, Raymond	The Big Sleep	  “Maybe it just isn’t your day. I know you, Mr. Mars. The Cypress Club at Las Olindas. Flash gambling for flash people. The local law in your pocket and a well-greased line into L.A. In other words, protection. Geiger was in a racket that needed that too. Perhaps you spared him a little now and then, seeing he’s your tenant.”    His mouth became a hard white grimace. “Geiger was in what racket?”    “The smut book racket.”    He stared at me for a long level minute. “Somebody got to him,” he said softly. “You know something about it. He didn’t show at the store today. They don’t know where he is. He didn’t answer the phone here. I came up to see about it. I find blood on the floor, under a rug. And you and a girl here.”    “A little weak,” I said. “But maybe you can sell the story to a willing buyer. You missed a little something, though. Somebody moved his books out of the store today—the nice books he rented out.”    He snapped his fingers sharply and said: “I should have thought of that, soldier. You seem to get around. How do you figure it?”    “I think Geiger was rubbed. I think that is his blood. And the books being moved out gives a motive for hiding the body for a while. Somebody is taking over the racket and wants a little time to organize.”    “They can’t get away with it,” Eddie Mars said grimly. 
thebigsleep.txt	126	7.0	1939	Chandler, Raymond	The Big Sleep	His breath made a soft hissing sound in the quiet room. He said very quietly: “You haven’t had to tell any of my men where to put their feet, smart guy.”    “We’ll see about that,” Ohls said. “This chauffeur I spoke of that’s drowned off Lido shot a guy last night in your territory. A guy named Geiger who ran a dirty book racket in a store on Hollywood Boulevard. Geiger was living with the punk I got outside in my car. I mean living with him, if you get the idea.”    Cronjager was staring at him levelly now. “That sounds like it might grow up to be a dirty story,” he said.    “It’s my experience most police stories are,” Ohls growled and turned to me, his eyebrows bristling. “You’re on the air, Marlowe. Give it to him.”    I gave it to him.    I left out two things, not knowing just why, at the moment, I left out one of them. I left out Carmen’s visit to Brody’s apartment and Eddie Mars’ visit to Geiger’s in the afternoon. I told the rest of it just as it happened.    Cronjager never took his eyes off my face and no expression of any kind crossed his as I talked. At the end of it he was perfectly silent for a long minute. Wilde was silent, sipping his coffee, puffing gently at his dappled cigar. Ohls stared at one of his thumbs. 
thebigsleep.txt	138	60.0	1939	Chandler, Raymond	The Big Sleep	  I read all three of the morning papers over my eggs and bacon the next morning. Their accounts of the affair came as close to the truth as newspaper stories usually come—as close as Mars is to Saturn. None of the three connected Owen Taylor, driver of the Lido Pier Suicide Car, with the Laurel Canyon Exotic Bungalow Slaying. None of them mentioned the Sternwoods, Bernie Ohls or me. Owen Taylor was “chauffeur to a wealthy family.” Captain Cronjager of the Hollywood Division got all the credit for solving the two slayings in his district, which were supposed to arise out of a dispute over the proceeds from a wire service maintained by one Geiger in the back of the bookstore on Hollywood Boulevard. Brody had shot Geiger and Carol Lundgren had shot Brody in revenge. Police were holding Carol Lundgren in custody. He had confessed. He had a bad record—probably in high school. Police were also holding one Agnes Lozelle, Geiger’s secretary, as a material witness.    It was a nice write-up. It gave the impression that Geiger had been killed the night before, that Brody had been killed about an hour later, and that Captain Cronjager had solved both murders while lighting a cigarette. The suicide of Taylor made Page One of Section II. There was a photo of the sedan on the deck of the power lighter, with the license plate blacked out, and something covered with a cloth lying on the deck beside the running board. Owen Taylor had been despondent and in poor health. His family lived in Dubuque, and his body would be shipped there. There would be no inquest. 
thebigsleep.txt	161	2.0	1939	Chandler, Raymond	The Big Sleep	  “Something the matter, Mrs. Regan?”    She turned her face to him with a sort of lunge. I saw the curve of her cheek stiffen, as if with an almost unbearable inner tautness. She didn’t answer him.    Eddie Mars said gravely: “If you’re not playing any more, you must let me send someone home with you.”    The girl flushed. Her cheekbones stood out white in her face. Then she laughed off-key. She said bitterly:    “One more play, Eddie. Everything I have on the red. I like red. It’s the color of blood.”    Eddie Mars smiled faintly, then nodded and reached into his inner breast pocket. He drew out a large pinseal wallet with gold corners and tossed it carelessly along the table to the croupier. “Cover her bet in even thousands,” he said, “if no one objects to this turn of the wheel being just for the lady.”    No one objected, Vivian Regan leaned down and pushed all her winnings savagely with both hands on to the large red diamond on the layout.    The croupier leaned over the table without haste. He counted and stacked her money and chips, placed all but a few chips and bills in a neat pile and pushed the rest back off the layout with his rake. He opened Eddie Mars’ wallet and drew out two flat packets of thousand-dollar bills. He broke one, counted six bills out, added them to the unbroken packet, put the four loose bills in the wallet and laid it aside as carelessly as if it had been a packet of matches. Eddie Mars didn’t touch the wallet. Nobody moved except the croupier. He spun the wheel left-handed and sent the ivory ball skittering along the upper edge with a casual flirt of his wrist. Then he drew his hands back and folded his arms. 
thebigsleep.txt	164	4.0	1939	Chandler, Raymond	The Big Sleep	  I waited, behind the tree.            TWENTY-THREE    Light steps, the steps of a woman, came along the invisible pathway and the man in front of me moved forward and seemed to lean against the fog. I couldn’t see the woman, then I could see her indistinctly. The arrogant carriage of her head seemed familiar. The man stepped out very quickly. The two figures blended in the fog, seemed to be part of the fog. There was dead silence for a moment. Then the man said:    “This is a gun, lady. Gentle now. Sound carries in the fog. Just hand me the bag.”    The girl didn’t make a sound. I moved forward a step. Quite suddenly I could see the foggy fuzz on the man’s hat brim. The girl stood motionless. Then her breathing began to make a rasping sound, like a small file on soft wood.    “Yell,” the man said, “and I’ll cut you in half.”    She didn’t yell. She didn’t move. There was a movement from him, and a dry chuckle. “It better be in here,” he said. A catch clicked and a fumbling sound came to me. The man turned and came towards my tree. When he had taken three or four steps he chuckled again. The chuckle was something out of my own memories. I reached a pipe out of my pocket and held it like a gun. 
thebigsleep.txt	185	120.0	1939	Chandler, Raymond	The Big Sleep	          TWENTY-FIVE    It was raining again the next morning, a slanting gray rain like a swung curtain of crystal beads. I got up feeling sluggish and tired and stood looking out of the windows, with a dark harsh taste of Sternwoods still in my mouth. I was as empty of life as a scarecrow’s pockets. I went out to the kitchenette and drank two cups of black coffee. You can have a hangover from other things than alcohol. I had one from women. Women made me sick.    I shaved and showered and dressed and got my raincoat out and went downstairs and looked out of the front door. Across the street, a hundred feet up, a gray Plymouth sedan was parked. It was the same one that had tried to trail me around the day before, the same one that I had asked Eddie Mars about. There might be a cop in it, if a cop had that much time on his hands and wanted to waste it following me around. Or it might be a smoothie in the detective business trying to get a noseful of somebody else’s case in order to chisel a way into it. Or it might be the Bishop of Bermuda disapproving of my night life. 
thebigsleep.txt	198	1440.0	1939	Chandler, Raymond	The Big Sleep	  I thought about it most of the day. Nobody came into the office. Nobody called me on the phone. It kept on raining.            TWENTY-SIX    At seven the rain had stopped for a breathing spell, but the gutters were still flooded. On Santa Monica the water was level with the sidewalk and a thin film of it washed over the top of the curbing. A traffic cop in shining black rubber from boots to cap sloshed through the flood on his way from the shelter of a sodden awning. My rubber heels slithered on the sidewalk as I turned into the narrow lobby of the Fulwider Building. A single drop light burned far back, beyond an open, once gilt elevator. There was a tarnished and well-missed spittoon on a gnawed rubber mat. A case of false teeth hung on the mustard-colored wall like a fuse box in a screen porch. I shook the rain off my hat and looked at the building directory beside the case of teeth. Numbers with names and numbers without names. Plenty of vacancies or plenty of tenants who wished to remain anonymous. Painless dentists, shyster detective agencies, small sick businesses that had crawled there to die, mail order schools that would teach you how to become a railroad clerk or a radio technician or a screen writer—if the postal inspectors didn’t catch up with them first. A nasty building. A building in which the smell of stale cigar butts would be the cleanest odor. 
thebigsleep.txt	199	2.0	1939	Chandler, Raymond	The Big Sleep	  An old man dozed in the elevator, on a ramshackle stool, with a burst-out cushion under him. His mouth was open, his veined temples glistened in the weak light. He wore a blue uniform coat that fitted him the way a stall fits a horse. Under that gray trousers with frayed cuffs, white cotton socks and black kid shoes, one of which was slit across a bunion. On the stool he slept miserably, waiting for a customer. I went past him softly, the clandestine air of the building prompting me, found the fire door and pulled it open. The fire stairs hadn’t been swept in a month. Bums had slept on them, eaten on them, left crusts and fragments of greasy newspaper, matches, a gutted imitation-leather pocketbook. In a shadowy angle against the scribbled wall a pouched ring of pale rubber had fallen and had not been disturbed. A very nice building.    I came out at the fourth floor sniffing for air. The hallway had the same dirty spittoon and frayed mat, the same mustard walls, the same memories of low tide. I went down the line and turned a corner. The name: “L. D. Walgreen—Insurance,” showed on a dark pebbled glass door, on a second dark door, on a third behind which there was a light. One of the dark doors said: “Entrance.”    A glass transom was open above the lighted door. Through it the sharp bird-like voice of Harry Jones spoke, saying:    “Canino? . . . Yeah, I’ve seen you around somewhere. Sure.”    I froze. The other voice spoke. It had a heavy purr, like a small dynamo behind a brick wall. It said: “I thought you would.” There was a vaguely sinister note in that voice. 
thebigsleep.txt	211	60.0	1939	Chandler, Raymond	The Big Sleep	They turned off on this road and Joe swung around and went back and we saw the car turn off the road where the frame house was. We sat there half an hour looking through the cars going by. Nobody came back out. When it was quite dark Joe sneaked up there and took a look. He said there were lights in the house and a radio was going and just the one car out in front, the coupe. So we beat it.”    She stopped talking and I listened to the swish of tires on Wilshire. I said: “They might have shifted quarters since then but that’s what you have to sell—that’s what you have to sell. Sure you knew her?”    “If you ever see her, you won’t make a mistake the second time. Good-bye, copper, and wish me luck. I got a raw deal.”    “Like hell you did,” I said, and walked away across the street to my own car.    The gray Plymouth moved forward, gathered speed, and darted around the corner onto Sunset Place. The sound of its motor died, and with it blonde Agnes wiped herself off the slate for good, so far as I was concerned. Three men dead, Geiger, Brody and Harry Jones, and the woman went riding off in the rain with my two hundred in her bag and not a mark on her. I kicked my starter and drove on downtown to eat. I ate a good dinner. Forty miles in the rain is a hike, and I hoped to make it a round trip. 
thebigsleep.txt	271	3.0	1939	Chandler, Raymond	The Big Sleep	“Forget Eddie. I’ll go see him after I get some rest. I’ll handle Eddie.” “He’ll try to kill you.” “Yeah,” I said. “His best boy couldn’t. I’ll take a chance on the others. Does Norris know?” “He’ll never tell.” “I thought he knew.” I went quickly away from her down the room and out and down the tiled staircase to the front hall. I didn’t see anybody when I left. I found my hat alone this time. Outside the bright gardens had a haunted look, as though small wild eyes were watching me from behind the bushes, as though the sunshine itself had a mysterious something in its light. I got into my car and drove off down the hill.
thebigsleep.txt	272	60.0	1939	Chandler, Raymond	The Big Sleep	  What did it matter where you lay once you were dead? In a dirty sump or in a marble tower on top of a high hill? You were dead, you were sleeping the big sleep, you were not bothered by things like that. Oil and water were the same as wind and air to you. You just slept the big sleep, not caring about the nastiness of how you died or where you fell. Me, I was part of the nastiness now. Far more a part of it than Rusty Regan was. But the old man didn’t have to be. He could lie quiet in his canopied bed, with his bloodless hands folded on the sheet, waiting. His heart was a brief, uncertain murmur. His thoughts were as gray as ashes. And in a little while he too, like Rusty Regan, would be sleeping the big sleep.        On the way downtown I stopped at a bar and had a couple of double Scotches. They didn’t do me any good. All they did was make me think of Silver-Wig, and I never saw her again. 
ElliRI.txt	0	13140000.0	1952	Ellison, Ralph	Invisible Man	Prologue      I am an invisible man. No, I am not a spook like those who haunted Edgar Allan Poe; nor am I one of your Hollywood-movie ectoplasms. I am a man of substance, of flesh and bone, fiber and liquids—and I might even be said to possess a mind. I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me. Like the bodiless heads you see sometimes in circus sideshows, it is as though I have been surrounded by mirrors of hard, distorting glass. When they approach me they see only my surroundings, themselves, or figments of their imagination—indeed, everything and anything except me.    Nor is my invisibility exactly a matter of a biochemical accident to my epidermis. That invisibility to which I refer occurs because of a peculiar disposition of the eyes of those with whom I come in contact. A matter of the construction of their inner eyes, those eyes with which they look through their physical eyes upon reality. I am not complaining, nor am I protesting either. It is sometimes advantageous to be unseen, although it is most often rather wearing on the nerves. Then too, you’re constantly being bumped against by those of poor vision. Or again, you often doubt if you really exist. You wonder whether you aren’t simply a phantom in other people’s minds. Say, a figure in a nightmare which the sleeper tries with all his strength to destroy. It’s when you feel like this that, out of resentment, you begin to bump people back. And, let me confess, you feel that way most of the time. You ache with the need to convince yourself that you do exist in the real world, that you’re a part of all the sound and anguish, and you strike out with your fists, you curse and you swear to make them recognize you. And, alas, it’s seldom successful. 
ElliRI.txt	1	3.0	1952	Ellison, Ralph	Invisible Man	  One night I accidentally bumped into a man, and perhaps because of the near darkness he saw me and called me an insulting name. I sprang at him, seized his coat lapels and demanded that he apologize. He was a tall blond man, and as my face came close to his he looked insolently out of his blue eyes and cursed me, his breath hot in my face as he struggled. I pulled his chin down sharp upon the crown of my head, butting him as I had seen the West Indians do, and I felt his flesh tear and the blood gush out, and I yelled, “Apologize! Apologize!” But he continued to curse and struggle, and I butted him again and again until he went down heavily, on his knees, profusely bleeding. I kicked him repeatedly, in a frenzy because he still uttered insults though his lips were frothy with blood. Oh yes, I kicked him! And in my outrage I got out my knife and prepared to slit his throat, right there beneath the lamplight in the deserted street, holding him in the collar with one hand, and opening the knife with my teeth—when it occurred to me that the man had not seen me, actually; that he, as far as he knew, was in the midst of a walking nightmare! And I stopped the blade, slicing the air as I pushed him away, letting him fall back to the street.
ElliRI.txt	58	2.0	1952	Ellison, Ralph	Invisible Man	  “It is, sir,” I said. “That one and the other two like it were built during slavery times.”    “You don’t say! I would never have believed that they were so enduring. Since slavery times!”    “That’s true, sir. And the white family that owned the land when it was a big plantation still lives in town.”    “Yes,” he said, “I know that many of the old families still survive. And individuals too, the human stock goes on, even though it degenerates. But these cabins!” He seemed surprised and confounded.    “Do you suppose those women know anything about the age and history of the place? The older one looks as though she might.”    “I doubt it, sir. They—they don’t seem very bright.”    “Bright?” he said, removing his cigar. “You mean that they wouldn’t talk with me?” he asked suspiciously.    “Yes, sir. That’s it.”    “Why not?”    I didn’t want to explain. It made me feel ashamed, but he sensed that I knew something and pressed me.    “It’s not very nice, sir. But I don’t think those women would talk to us.”    “We can explain that we’re from the school. Surely they’ll talk then. You may tell them who I am.”    “Yes, sir,” I said, “but they hate us up at the school. They never come there …”    “What!”    “No, sir.”    “And those children along the fence down there?”    “They don’t either, sir.”    “But why?”    “I don’t really know, sir. Quite a few folks out this way don’t, though. I guess they’re too ignorant. They’re not interested.”    “But I can’t believe it.”    The children had stopped playing and now looked silently at the car, their arms behind their backs and their new oversized overalls pulled tight over their little pot bellies as though they too were pregnant. 
ElliRI.txt	120	1.6	1952	Ellison, Ralph	Invisible Man	  “Hurry, the man is as insane as the rest,” Mr. Norton said.    “Yes, sir,” I said, noticing a new note in his voice.    The balcony was now as noisy as the floor below. The girls and drunken vets were stumbling about with drinks in their hands. Just as we went past an open door Edna saw us and grabbed my arm.    “Where you taking white-folks?” she demanded.    “Back to school,” I said, shaking her off.    “You don’t want to go up there, white-folks, baby,” she said. I tried to push past her. “I ain’t lying,” she said. “I’m the best little home-maker in the business.”    “Okay, but please let us alone,” I pleaded. “You’ll get me into trouble.”    We were going down the stairs into the milling men now and she started to scream, “Pay me then! If he’s too good for me, let him pay!”    And before I could stop her she had pushed Mr. Norton, and both of us were stumbling swiftly down the stairs. I landed against a man who looked up with the anonymous familiarity of a drunk and shoved me hard away. I saw Mr. Norton spin past as I sank farther into the crowd. Somewhere I could hear the girl screaming and Halley’s voice yelling, “Hey! Hey! Hey, now!” Then I was aware of fresh air and saw that I was near the door and pushed my way free and stood panting and preparing to plunge back for Mr. Norton—when I heard Halley calling, “Make way y’all!” and saw him piloting Mr. Norton to the door. 
ElliRI.txt	170	30.0	1952	Ellison, Ralph	Invisible Man	  Uttering apologies, Dr. Bledsoe helped him to his chair. Then as the old man rested back with a smile, Dr. Bledsoe walked to the edge of the platform and lifted his arms. I closed my eyes as I heard the deep moaning sound that issued from him, and the rising crescendo of the student body joining in. This time it was music sincerely felt, not rendered for the guests, but for themselves; a song of hope and exaltation. I wanted to rush from the building, but didn’t dare. I sat stiff and erect, supported by the hard bench, relying upon it as upon a form of hope.    I could not look at Dr. Bledsoe now, because old Barbee had made me both feel my guilt and accept it. For although I had not intended it, any act that endangered the continuity of the dream was an act of treason.    I did not listen to the next speaker, a tall white man who kept dabbing at his eyes with a handkerchief and repeating his phrases in an emotional and inarticulate manner. Then the orchestra played excerpts from Dvořák’s New World Symphony and I kept hearing “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot” resounding through its dominant theme—my mother’s and grandfather’s favorite spiritual. It was more than I could stand, and before the next speaker could begin I hurried past the disapproving eyes of teachers and matrons, out into the night. 
ElliRI.txt	233	1.4	1952	Ellison, Ralph	Invisible Man	  “Yes. That’s a way of putting it. Because to help you I must disillusion you …”    “Oh, I don’t think I mind, sir. Once I see Mr. Emerson, it’ll be up to me. All I want to do is speak to him.”    “Speak to him,” he said, getting quickly to his feet and mashing his cigarette into the tray with shaking fingers. “No one speaks to him. He does the speaking—” Suddenly he broke off. “On second thought, perhaps you’d better leave me your address and I’ll mail you Mr. Emerson’s reply in the morning. He’s really a very busy man.”    His whole manner had changed.    “But you said …” I stood up, completely confused. Was he having fun with me? “Couldn’t you let me talk to him for just five minutes?” I pleaded. “I’m sure I can convince him that I’m worthy of a job. And if there’s someone who has tampered with my letter, I’ll prove my identity … Dr. Bledsoe would—”    “Identity! My God! Who has any identity anymore anyway? It isn’t so perfectly simple. Look,” he said with an anguished gesture. “Will you trust me?”    “Why, yes, sir, I trust you.”    He leaned forward. “Look,” he said, his face working violently, “I was trying to tell you that I know many things about you—not you personally, but fellows like you. Not much, either, but still more than the average. With us it’s still Jim and Huck Finn.
ElliRI.txt	263	1.2	1952	Ellison, Ralph	Invisible Man	  Running the rag over a gauge I wondered how an apparently uneducated old man could gain such a responsible job. He certainly didn’t sound like an engineer; yet he alone was on duty. And you could never be sure, for at home an old man employed as a janitor at the Water Works was the only one who knew the location of all of the water mains. He had been employed at the beginning, before any records were kept, and actually functioned as an engineer though he drew a janitor’s pay. Perhaps this old Brockway was protecting himself from something. After all, there was antagonism to our being employed. Maybe he was dissimulating, like some of the teachers at the college, who, to avoid trouble when driving through the small surrounding towns, wore chauffeur caps and pretended that their cars belonged to white men. But why was he pretending with me? And what was his job?    I looked around me. It was not just an engine room; I knew, for I had been in several, the last at college. It was something more. For one thing, the furnaces were made differently and the flames that flared through the cracks of the fire chambers were too intense and too blue. And there were the odors. No, he was making something down here, something that had to do with paint, and probably something too filthy and dangerous for white men to be willing to do even for money. It was not paint because I had been told that the paint was made on the floors above, where, passing through, I had seen men in splattered aprons working over large vats filled with whirling pigment. One thing was certain: I had to be careful with this crazy Brockway; he didn’t like my being here … And there he was, entering the room now from the stairs. 
ElliRI.txt	266	2.0	1952	Ellison, Ralph	Invisible Man	  “Oh, sho, sho,” he said. “Sho. But you better take a rest when you git tired.”    I didn’t stop. I piled on the material until he said, “That there’s the scoop we been trying to find. That’s what we want. You better stand back a little, ’cause I’m fixing to start her up.”    I backed away, watching him go over and push a switch. Shuddering into motion, the machine gave a sudden scream like a circular saw, and sent a tattoo of sharp crystals against my face. I moved clumsily away, seeing Brockway grin like a dried prune. Then with the dying hum of the furiously whirling drums, I heard the grains sifting lazily in the sudden stillness, sliding sand-like down the chute into the pot underneath.    I watched him go over and open a valve. A sharp new smell of oil arose.    “Now she’s all set to cook down; all we got to do is put the fire to her,” he said, pressing a button on something that looked like the burner of an oil furnace. There was an angry hum, followed by a slight explosion that caused something to rattle, and I could hear a low roaring begin.    “Know what that’s going to be when it’s cooked?”    “No, sir,” I said. 
ElliRI.txt	334	0.7497	1952	Ellison, Ralph	Invisible Man	  “Hon, Hon,” he said, placing his hand on her shoulder. “It’s the agent, not these gentlemen. He’s the one. He says it’s in the bank, but you know he’s the one. We’ve done business with him for over twenty years.”    “Don’t tell me,” she said. “It’s all the white folks, not just one. They all against us. Every stinking low-down one of them.”    “She’s right!” a hoarse voice said. “She’s right! They all is!”    Something had been working fiercely inside me, and for a moment I had forgotten the rest of the crowd. Now I recognized a self-consciousness about them, as though they, we, were ashamed to witness the eviction, as though we were all unwilling intruders upon some shameful event; and thus we were careful not to touch or stare too hard at the effects that lined the curb; for we were witnesses of what we did not wish to see, though curious, fascinated, despite our shame, and through it all the old female, mind-plunging crying.    I looked at the old people, feeling my eyes burn, my throat tighten. The old woman’s sobbing was having a strange effect upon me—as when a child, seeing the tears of its parents, is moved by both fear and sympathy to cry. I turned away, feeling myself being drawn to the old couple by a warm, dark, rising whirlpool of emotion which I feared. I was wary of what the sight of them crying there on the sidewalk was making me begin to feel. I wanted to leave, but was too ashamed to leave, was rapidly becoming too much a part of it to leave. 
ElliRI.txt	375	1.2	1952	Ellison, Ralph	Invisible Man	  “How about a drink for us, Emma?” Brother Jack said.    “Well, now, I’ll have to think about it,” she said, tilting her severely drawn head and smiling.    “Don’t think, act,” he said. “We’re very thirsty men. This young man pushed history ahead twenty years today.”    “Oh,” she said, her eyes becoming intent. “You must tell me about him.”    “Just read the morning papers, Emma. Things have begun to move. Yes, leap ahead.” He laughed deeply.    “What would you like, Brother?” she said, her eyes brushing slowly over my face.    “Bourbon,” I said, a little too loudly, as I remembered the best the South had to offer. My face was warm, but I returned her glance as steadily as I dared. It was not the harsh uninterested-in-you-as-a-human-being stare that I’d known in the South, the kind that swept over a black man as though he were a horse or an insect; it was something more, a direct, what-type-of-mere-man-have-we-here kind of look that seemed to go beneath my skin … Somewhere in my leg a muscle twitched violently.    “Emma, the bourbon! Two bourbons,” Brother Jack said. 
ElliRI.txt	499	2.0	1952	Ellison, Ralph	Invisible Man	  “Brothers, please,” Brother Jack said. “One at a time. What do you know about this article?” he said to me.    “Not very much,” I said. “The editor of the magazine called to say he was sending a reporter up for an interview. The reporter asked a few questions and took a few pictures with a little camera. That’s all I know.”    “Did you give the reporter a prepared handout?”    “I gave her nothing except a few pieces of our official literature. I told her neither what to ask me nor what to write. I naturally tried to co-operate. If an article about me would help make friends for the movement I felt it was my duty.”    “Brothers, this thing was arranged,” Wrestrum said. “I tell you this opportunist had that reporter sent up there. He had her sent up and he told her what to write.”    “That’s a contemptible lie,” I said. “You were present and you know I tried to get them to interview Brother Clifton!”    “Who’s a lie?”    “You’re a liar and a fat-mouthed scoundrel. You’re a liar and no brother of mine.”    “Now he’s calling me names. Brothers, you heard him.”    “Let’s not lose our tempers,” Brother Jack said calmly. “Brother Wrestrum, you’ve made serious charges. Can you prove them?”    “I can prove them. All you have to do is read the magazine and prove them for yourself.”    “It will be read.

Finally I rang her number, hearing her voice, delighted, gay and discreet; but no mention of the night or the man. And hearing her so composed and gay I was too embarrassed to bring it up. Perhaps this was the sophisticated and civilized way? Perhaps he was there and they had an understanding, a woman with full rights.    Would I return for further discussion, she wanted to know.    “Yes, of course,” I said.    “Oh, Brother,” she said.    I hung up with a mixture of relief and anxiety, unable to shrug off the notion that I had been tested and had failed. I went through the next week puzzling over it, and even more confused because I knew nothing definite of where I stood. I tried to detect any changes in my relations with Brother Jack and the others, but they gave no sign. And even if they had, I wouldn’t have known its definite meaning, for it might have had to do with the charges. I was caught between guilt and innocence, so that now they seemed one and the same. My nerves were in a state of constant tension, my face took on a stiff, noncommittal expression, beginning to look like Brother Jack’s and the other leaders’. Then I relaxed a bit; work had to be done and I would play the waiting game.
ElliRI.txt	528	7.0	1952	Ellison, Ralph	Invisible Man	  Barrelhouse had prepared me for the darkened windows of the district, but not, when I let myself in, to call in vain through the dark to Brother Tarp. I went to the room where he slept, but he was not there; then I went through the dark hall to my old office and threw myself into my desk chair, exhausted. Everything seemed to be slipping away from me and I could find no quick absorbing action that would get it under control. I tried to think of whom among the district committee I might call for information concerning Clifton, but here again I was balked. For if I selected one who believed that I had requested to be transferred because I hated my own people it would only complicate matters. No doubt there would be some who’d resent my return, so it was best to confront them all at once without giving any one of them the opportunity to organize any sentiment against me. It was best that I talk with Brother Tarp, whom I trusted. When he came in he could give me an idea of the state of affairs, and perhaps tell me what had actually happened to Clifton. 
ElliRI.txt	547	9.0	1952	Ellison, Ralph	Invisible Man	Men out of time, who would soon be gone and forgotten … But who knew (and now I began to tremble so violently I had to lean against a refuse can)—who knew but that they were the saviors, the true leaders, the bearers of something precious? The stewards of something uncomfortable, burdensome, which they hated because, living outside the realm of history, there was no one to applaud their value and they themselves failed to understand it. What if Brother Jack were wrong? What if history was a gambler, instead of a force in a laboratory experiment, and the boys his ace in the hole? What if history was not a reasonable citizen, but a madman full of paranoid guile and these boys his agents, his big surprise! His own revenge? For they were outside, in the dark with Sambo, the dancing paper doll; taking it on the lambo with my fallen brother, Tod Clifton (Tod, Tod) running and dodging the forces of history instead of making a dominating stand.    A train came. I followed them inside. There were many seats and the three sat together. I stood, holding onto the center pole, looking down the length of the car. On one side I saw a white nun in black telling her beads, and standing before the door across the aisle there was another dressed completely in white, the exact duplicate of the other except that she was black and her black feet bare. Neither of the nuns was looking at the other but at their crucifixes, and suddenly I laughed and a verse I’d heard long ago at the Golden Day paraphrased itself in my mind:    Bread and Wine,    Bread and Wine,    Your cross ain’t nearly so    Heavy as mine …        And the nuns rode on with lowered heads. 
ElliRI.txt	721	2628000.0	1952	Ellison, Ralph	Invisible Man	  In going underground, I whipped it all except the mind, the mind. And the mind that has conceived a plan of living must never lose sight of the chaos against which that pattern was conceived. That goes for societies as well as for individuals. Thus, having tried to give pattern to the chaos which lives within the pattern of your certainties, I must come out, I must emerge. And there’s still a conflict within me: With Louis Armstrong one half of me says, “Open the window and let the foul air out,” while the other says, “It was good green corn before the harvest.” Of course Louis was kidding, he wouldn’t have thrown old Bad Air out, because it would have broken up the music and the dance, when it was the good music that came from the bell of old Bad Air’s horn that counted. Old Bad Air is still around with his music and his dancing and his diversity, and I’ll be up and around with mine. And, as I said before, a decision has been made. I’m shaking off the old skin and I’ll leave it here in the hole. I’m coming out, no less invisible without it, but coming out nevertheless. And I suppose it’s damn well time. Even hibernations can be overdone, come to think of it. Perhaps that’s my greatest social crime, I’ve overstayed my hibernation, since there’s a possibility that even an invisible man has a socially responsible role to play.

He only wanted us to listen to him rave!” But only partially true: Being invisible and without substance, a disembodied voice, as it were, what else could I do? What else but try to tell you what was really happening when your eyes were looking through? And it is this which frightens me:    Who knows but that, on the lower frequencies, I speak for you? 
SwarGT.txt	0	10512000.0	1964	Swarthout, Glendon Fred	The Cadillac cowboys	1      REQUIESCAT      WICKENBURG — Mrs. Jeanette Champie, 93, Arizona pioneer, died Tuesday in Phoenix. Born in Comfort, Texas, Mrs. Champie moved to Arizona in 1888 with her husband, the late A.F. Champie, with whom she celebrated their 62nd wedding anniversary in 1945. Mr. Champie was a mining man and the couple resided in several Yavapai County mining towns until they moved to Wickenburg. Mrs. Champie’s early days in the Arizona Territory were laced with harrowing experiences. She was often forced to cope with raiding Indians. Once she shot a mountain lion out of a tree directly above her while her young children gathered about her in terror.            2      WHEN      This nation’s history is the richer because a few of our forefathers had the gumption and literacy to put down on paper a day-to-day chronicle of their adventures as they bustled our frontier westward. Such accounts are invaluable. They spank life and breath into the past. We treasure them in family Bibles, in library collections of Americana, and in print. But there has taken place in the last twenty years the most incredible mass traipse from East to West that any country has ever known. It is The Great American Sashay. From Grand Forks to Norfolk, from Skowhegan to Shreveport, hordes of New Pioneers have hit the trail in search of whatever they have lost, or what they never found. U-Drive-It trains of superhighway settlers have peopled The Fancy Dress Frontier of the 1950’s and 1960’s. Who will record for the future their vicissitudes and victories? Who will tell this chromium-plated Eastern Western story? 
SwarGT.txt	1	1576800.0	1964	Swarthout, Glendon Fred	The Cadillac cowboys	  I nominate myself, H. Carleton Cadell, husband and father, yokel and intellectual, late of Old Wycherley, Connecticut, and better late than ever.    Call me a Cadillac cowboy if you will. The Grand Central Station Gang, my former fellow-riders on the New York, New Haven & Hartford stage line, insult me, so I hear, with labels similarly choice. “Billy the Button-Down Kid,” they scoff, or “The T.S. Eliot Tenderfoot” or “Wyatt Earp with an Attache Case.”    Let them have their jest. Archetype of the dude I may be, but I have gone west now, where men are men and where, when you say such things, stranger, you smile.    It was books, not a six-gun, which sent me packing, which made of me a dilettante Don Quixote gone daft from reading. For some time after marriage I pretended industry by commuting now and then from our estate to New York, to the Public Library, and there for several hours doing research for a possible Ph.D. in history. By chance I crossed a Mississippi of the mind and commenced to graze with rising appetite in a territory of Indians and ranchers and cavalry and gunflghters and romance from whence I was never emotionally to return. As a historian I had found my era, as a man my place. Stooped, spindle-shanked, thick-lensed, balding pedant—not I! In this bony breast there snorted a bison, there swaggered a roistering mountain man, there was born, a civilization too late, a stripling Teddy Roosevelt hot for deeds of derring-do! 
SwarGT.txt	21	2880.0	1964	Swarthout, Glendon Fred	The Cadillac cowboys	Boyd.”    “An’ you jes’ call me Eddie Bud.”            6      PARTNER      I was hard put to let even a polite interval pass before seeking out Eddie Bud Boyd. I had come, in a sense, three thousand miles to meet, to accredit, indeed to bard this man! The second day, therefore, after the heavy hors d’oeuvres party and the rescue of the deer, I hit the trail on foot across several acres of desert and up to Fast Draw Drive, a new street on which, it gradually dawned on me, there was but one house, the scandal of Temptation Valley, the only one the Boyds could possibly have bought! Everyone called it the “Trader Vic” house, and in fact, with its rococo-Polynesian roof lines, its violent coral siding, its spear-and-grass ornamentation, its full-sized prau, or dugout canoe, hanging in the carport, it did resemble a restaurant rather than a residence. Perched vertiginously on a ledge of rock above two other homes and priced at $250,000, it had gone buyerless for over a year and been the subject of debate about whether or not anyone in possession of any faculties could ever be suckered into such an eyesore. Someone had been. A mailbox in the shape of a coconut named the victim as “E.B. Boyd.”    Like Captain Cook I made my way through a farrow of delivery trucks and landscapers lowering eucalyptus and cacti into holes and under a fronded entry through the front door, which was open. What I entered was a movie set, not a living room. The ceiling was thatched with palm fronds. 
SwarGT.txt	38	1.0	1964	Swarthout, Glendon Fred	The Cadillac cowboys	“Sorry,” I smiled, “but we’ve had to draw the line. You understand, I’m sure. We let one anachronism in and they’ll all want in.”    “No, Carleton, not for the golf! It’s so we’d have us a place t’ go an’ t’ meet folks an’ have frien’s. It’s so we’d b’long t’ somethin’ in town. Please, Carleton?”    Suddenly a breeze cleared the smoke from his burnished, youthful countenance. I looked into eyes as trusting and supplicant as a captive deer’s. For once in my life I met innocence cornea to cornea. The word has been debased. I mean innocence such as we associate with rosebuds, with babes in mangers, with graves and Grecian urns, with harps on high, with the most distant dewy dawnings of the earth. I mean innocence of such depth and rarity and truth that my heart literally turned within me, recoiled in shame that I had dared even for a moment to doubt its presence.    “Yes, Eddie Bud, I’ll get you in the club, I’ll help you, I’ll do everything!” I said, the words springing from my mouth like frogs. “You didn’t even have to ask!”    “Ah do thank you, Carleton. How come?”    “Because you’re the genuine, indubitable article,” I said. “Because in you the past still lives. Because in you I find all those qualities which have made the American character unique—daring, innocence, democracy, gusto, humor, cussedness, generosity, industry, vision, independence, horse sense, ingenuity, grit, sociability.” I swallowed the lump in my throat. 
SwarGT.txt	39	1.0	1964	Swarthout, Glendon Fred	The Cadillac cowboys	  “Because you’re the man I wish I had been.”    “Partner,” he said solemnly, extending his hand.    “Partner,” I said.    Emotion, emotion. So overwhelmed was I by admiration and love for the man, by sheer natal joy in him, by recognitions and revelations which had come too swiftly, that I rushed from the room, undergoing as I left the house the raven gaze of his small, mustachioed retainer. “Adios, Titano!” I cried. Answer came there none.            7      REQUIESCAT        CEDAR CREEK—In a simple tribal service, R-25, believed to be the last of the numbered Apaches, was buried here yesterday on the reservation where he lived for seventy-six years. His real name was Oga Altaha, but he was given the R-25 designation by Gen. George Crook many years ago when the old U.S. Cavalry identified the Apaches by serial numbers. Under clear skies and in a biting wind R-25 was carried to the cemetery in a plain pickup truck. Following tribal custom, the casket was buried facing east so he may always greet the rising sun. The Apaches believe strongly in immortality, so food, clothing, and a small jug of water were placed in Oga Altaha’s grave to insure comfort on the long journey to the hereafter.            8      HOW        Married money is best. About inherited wealth one must be modest, while that earned has invariably a sweaty odor; but riches gained by marriage are like manna fallen from Heaven. Devour them, I say, and damn the stomach acids. 
SwarGT.txt	48	7.0	1964	Swarthout, Glendon Fred	The Cadillac cowboys	  We may not believe with John Wesley that cleanliness is next to godliness, but we are secretly assured that altitude is next to beatitude.    “In the legends of the saints and prophets,” writes Krutch, my Socrates, “either a desert or a mountain is pretty sure to figure. It is either in the middle of one or on the top of the other that the vision comes or the test is met.” Conceive my dismay, then, this morning when, my feet on the desk, in a posture and state conducive to vision, the furniture, the very walls of the house commenced to vibrate, and there lunked into sight through my window an immense bulldozer. It rooted and snorted, raping, obviously, of the immaculate desert, a new street. I left the house and striding across the terrain shouted at the operator to cease and desist at once. He could not hear. Just as I snatched up a chunk of quartz to hurl at him, a jeep, following the machine, pulled up, and the driver introduced himself as Walt Duppa, the developer, he was proud to state, of Sarcophagus Shadows. He unrolled a plat. Sarcophagus Shadows was the eighty acres around us, running clear to the mountaintop; he had just bought it, he proposed to grade and pave streets, bring in utilities, and to get thirty building sites out of it. Progress, he said.    He wore a Foreign Legion kepi. Sternly I inquired if he needed the money? 
SwarGT.txt	83	2.5	1964	Swarthout, Glendon Fred	The Cadillac cowboys	Yeh, you better take it.”    “How much you write it for, partner?”    “Ten thousand’ dollahs, frien’.”    “Ten thousan’—”    “Yeh, now my partner ‘n me, we’ re goin’ out t’ my car an’ headin’ for Phoenix. You ain’t picked up thet check by the time we’re gone, it’s your funeral.”    “Funeral?”    At the word’s implication the showroom went deathly still. The very air seemed to crackle with conflict. Two employees, a secretary and a mechanic, scurried out of range.    “Boyd,” the dealer said slowly, “theah’s some things a man’ll do an’ some he won’t.”    “Huckabee,” replied the cattleman softly, “he wants t’ stay in business he will.”    The situation was irreversibly reversed. Amicable strangers only moments ago, buyer and seller were now combatants in a stylized, commercial showdown. They backed off from one another. Each seemed to assume his own version of the classic stance, the dealer slightly crouched, arms loose, right hand just below hip lever, the cattleman more erect, his budding belly flattened.    “You pushin’ me, Boyd.”    “Make your play, Huckabee.”    Under the wide hat brims, level, lethal stare met level lethal stare. Which would falter first, which would first betray? I edged behind the sedan. The drama was breathtaking, heroical, in the most genetic American tradition!    Suddenly, with a superb indifference, Boyd deliberately turned his back and strode out the door!    I hurried after him.    Wordless, we settled ourselves in the Buick. 
SwarGT.txt	84	1.0	1964	Swarthout, Glendon Fred	The Cadillac cowboys	  He had just started the engine when a hand appeared through the window.    “You win, partner. l’ll get them two cars ready t’ roll.”    They shook. Bill Huckabee retired. The entire transaction had been completed in ten minutes.    I was not too sapped by tension to applaud. “Eddie Bud, you were simply great!”    “Like takin’ candy from a baby.”    “No! It was a real coup de Cadillac!” But as we waited to take delivery of the automobiles, arithmetic triumphed over my emotion. “Ten thousand dollars,” I mused, “just like that.”    “Damn good deal. Carleton, if a thing’s bought right, it’s half sold.”    I was not reassured. To the $10,000 I added the $6000 for Titano’s searchlight and the $150,000 for the Trader Vic monstrosity, which had yet to be furnished, plus the $14,000 for the pool and the $1000 for saddles. The total, for a few weeks, was appalling. He had indeed come to town, and I had authenticated him, but apparently my functions, while chiefly tutorial, must also include those of spiritual guardian. I must help him buckle on his guns against temptation; I must stand at his side in the shoot-out with Profligacy.

Fortunately I was not present, nor would I have been morbid enough to question him, but his attorneys have provided me with a few of the details.    Recall that his home clings to the side of Sarcophagus Mountain. Situated in direct vertical line on the slope below are two other mansions owned, one would have assumed, by affluent and forgiving neighbors. These let us designate Houses #1 and #2. Recall, too, that on the verge of physical and nervous collapse I had staggered to my own domicile. What then ensued we may reconstruct as follows.    Forth he led the trembling Christabel, enthroning her behind the wheel of the convertible. In excess of pride he ordered her to take it around the block. She could not even start it. This he did for her, and showed her how to shift into drive. To the accelerator she put bare foot. In her behalf, let it be entered here that the unworldly girl had never before driven a vehicle more sophisticated than a pickup truck. Faced with automatic shift, power brakes, power steering, power windows, power seat, power top, and an array of other controls as intricate as those for guidance in space, she was helpless. Evidently she pulled and pushed everything. Perhaps it was the wrong bit for the beast, perhaps a burr under its saddle. “Whoa!” she screamed. But this was a steed foaled in Detroit, not in Colorado’s high country. The Cadillac bucked forward, then flinging gravel leaped across their acreage to a rendezvous with the law of gravity.

During my absence on the circuit, Dorene and Suzanne began riding lessons from a wrangler at a nearby resort, whose honorarium is $10 per hour. They also joined, bless their girlish hearts, a riding club located ten miles away, and this necessitated the purchase of a two-horse van, which in turn required a custom hitch for the rear bumper of the Bentley, which was scarcely designed for the hauling of horses. Thinking to ensalad the cuisine of their pets, moreover, the girls the other day fed them day-old clippings from the lawn piled up by our yard man. These had fermented. Pandora and Niobe have come down with colic, a malady characterized, according to my dictionary, by “Paroxysmal pain in the abdomen.” With agony they whinny. The veterinary arrives every hour on the hour.            23      PROPHET        Fate, fate. To rough it from Connecticut to Arizona seeking a new reverence for birds and beasts and botany, new significations of beneficence and spirituality among men, only to set oneself unwittingly down smack-dab in the middle of a real-estate development. Sarcophagus Shadows is a-building. For weeks the dynamiters have blasted troughs in rock for gas and water mains as wild creatures fled across my pleasance in panic, dispossessed forever of their hearths. For weeks the paving crews have rolled and rumbled and stunk.
SwarGT.txt	102	10.0	1964	Swarthout, Glendon Fred	The Cadillac cowboys	Yes, Christabel had learned how to drive the convertible. Yes, let’s have another round. Yes, all the devastation she had done on the mountainside had been paid for without resort to litigation, including a fresh brace of Katangan cockatoos. “Honey, you ever see so many pilgrims in your life?” “Once. Time ah went t’ Denver.” “At a movie picture?” “No. Theah was a fire.”    The lobby filled. The elite of Phoenix hung from the decor. An orchestra struck up and out. The lights dimmed, leaving only the runway in glare. To applause, the internationally renowned couturier to the internationally renowned, notorious Pierre Mannique, made an entrance to commentate his new collection, jetted out only that afternoon from his Fifth Avenue boutique.    Pierre informed us that alors, mesdames et messieurs, zis was ze year of ze “Bonbon Look.” To begin, he would illustrate with hats. The first model slithered down the runway with a bonbon of velvet crushed into her coif, to be followed by bonbons of silk, leather, and fur. Then came frocks, coats, ball gowns. Mannique was the real bonbon. A flit of the flittiest sort, his giggles were shrill, his hands darty as bats, and his accent seemed to me to have in it a soupcon of St. Paul-Minneapolis in addition to the Faubourg St.-Honore. Reba was interested. The Boyds were riveted. Neither of them had ever dreamed the sex might be so lavishly titivated. With side glances at his wife’s second-hand apparel, Eddie Bud dealt rapidly from his stack of scrip.

And when I gave him the roll of bills he did not even deign to count. “Thanks. Ciao, chaps.”    Our flight back across the haunted, patient reservation was like that of two thugs with their loot. “We hit us the jackpot, partner! They’re baled up like cotton, them rugs, but what ah could see, they’re pretty as money in the bank!”    Eddie Bud said once, but did not speak again until we junctioned with U.S. 66 on the outskirts of Flagstaff, where he pulled off onto the concrete apron by an all-night gasoline station. It was light here, he said, and there was something he wanted to see. First he’d borrow some wire cutters from the attendant. I waited in the pickup. It was midnight. Cars horneted past monotonously on U.S. 66, families sleeping inside, worldly goods jammed into trailers, all heading west, to California I hoped. Above me, north of Flagstaff, twelve-thousand-foot peaks ruminated. It was depressing to reflect that most of the beautiful, wooded acreage on their slopes belong not to the nation but to syndicates of movie stars. The commission man returned with a tool and climbed into the bed of the pickup.    There was sound and movement, then nothing. After several minutes I got out. Eddie Bud sat slumped. The wires around the bale were cut, and uncompressed rugs were strewn and scattered. 
SwarGT.txt	170	2.0	1964	Swarthout, Glendon Fred	The Cadillac cowboys	  I think it not without pertinence to recall that President Taft, having been harassed by the settlers out here to such personal purgatory that he admitted them to statehood, not long afterward registered his unyielding opposition to capital punishment—except in the case of Arizonans.            47      BAGATELLE        “Light of my life,” I said to Reba, “consider this a mere bagatelle. In the good old days Apache braves were wont to snick off the tips of their wives’ noses at the slightest provocation, even infidelity.”    But she was not to be humored out of it. She marched to the laundry room, there to bandage and console a bruised Annie, even to do the ironing in her stead. John Hochee, out of work and temperish, last night it seems laid hands on some firewater and then on the feckless Annie, beating, to be blunt, the be-Jesus out of her.    I did not like the retributive glint in Reba’s eye. “Bride of my autumn, buddy of my bed,” said I, “you have done all that anyone may do for the sake of the Original American. Leave well enough alone. In short, dear wife, mind henceforth your own business.”            48      DILEMMA        How felicitous was early Arizona’s choice of the cactus wren as state bird. Strutty, with a raucous song, its single ornithological function seems to be to despoil the landscape with beak and bowel.

The telephone directory listing of the Credit Bureau of Phoenix includes, for example, a Welcome Newcomer Dept. I lay it on the line. The party’s over. The West has had it. California is a shambles. As for Nevada, can you honestly contemplate living in Las Vegas? Beware of Utah unless you adopt the Mormon faith, for Brigham Young’s boys have sewed it up. New Mexico is all sheep, artists, nuclear research, oil rigs, and irreclaimable wilderness. Texas of course is unthinkable. Arizona remains, and one of you already arrives here every ten minutes only to find himself unable, after a short stay, to raise sufficient funds to leave.    In sum, buckaroos, the prairie schooners you have watched mogging across your television screens for years have finally reached their destination and disgorged more settlers than we can accommodate, more hopes than we can fulfill, more memories than we can quicken.    It has been said many times in many ways that the Western story is really more a myth about the East than it is about the West, and that only by becoming Westernized can the East be saved.

Should he ride again the Big Black Bronc, yelling eee-yah-hah, shooting out the neon stars, let him have his head. His like you will see no more. We have thrown away the mold. Or perhaps we have run out of the material. Concluding, I bowed my head a moment in amen, then looked upon Temptation Valley, night-thralled. To the noble vaults I raised my eyes, the splendor of the Western firmament. Toward the horizons I trained them, infernal not with Indian signal fires but with the glow, extinguished now yet vivid in my memory, of baseball parks and supermarkets and golf driving ranges and dog tracks and discount stores and hamburger drive-ins. It was then I saw that single blade of light which stabbed me to the soul. El-Hijo-Puts-Evil-Eye-On-El-Padre! I understood! From my throat was ripped a cry of anguish. Hunted, hounded, I fled the house!

High on his pedestal stood the midget, facing the East, supernatural, transcendental, about his sombrero and serape a nimbus of sixty million candle power. How had he known? How had he known?    “Oh God, Titano, oh God!” I shouted. “What have I done? What have I done?”    There was only the generator’s roaring malediction. I fought for grace, for forgiveness.    “Titano,” I cried, “if your cross is not knowing where to begin, I understand, I sympathize! Begin anywhere! But speak! Only a word! Speak, damn you!”    It was futile.    After I had caught my breath and started for the car I bade him a last importunate farewell, I made one final, piteous effort.    “Vaya con Dios, Titano!”            55      REQUIESCAT        NEW YORK—VARIETY, show business weekly, reports that the most popular Madison Avenue male model this year is clear-eyed, clean-lunged Eddie Bud Boyd, outdoor type from Arizona.

CHAP▪ I▪    Lord Angelo is precise;  Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses  That his blood flows, or that his appetite  Is more to bread than stone.  MEASURE FOR MEASURE.    SCARCELY had the abbey-bell tolled for five minutes, and already was the church of the Capuchins thronged with auditors. Do not encourage the idea, that the crowd was assembled either from motives of piety or thirst of information. But very few were influenced by those reasons; and in a city where superstition reigns with    such despotic sway as in Madrid, to seek for true devotion would be a fruitless attempt. The audience now assembled in the Capuchin church was collected by various causes, but all of them were foreign to the ostensible motive. The women came to show themselves, the men to see the women: some were attracted by curiosity to hear an orator so celebrated; some came, because they had no better means of employing their time till the play began; some, from being assured that it would be impossible to find places in the church; and one half of Madrid was brought thither by expecting to meet the other half. The only persons truly anxious to hear the preacher, were a few antiquated devotees, and half a dozen rival orators, determined to find fault with and ridicule the discourse. As to the remainder of the audience, the sermon might have been omitted altogether, certainly without their being disappointed, and very probably without their perceiving the omission.

Whatever was the occasion, it is at least certain, that the Capuchin church had never witnessed a more numerous assembly. Every corner was filled, every seat was occupied. The very statues which ornamented the long aisles were pressed into the service. Boys suspended themselves upon the wings of cherubims; St. Francis and St. Mark bore each a spectator on his shoulders; and St. Agatha found herself under the necessity of carrying double. The consequence was, that, in spite of all their hurry and expedition, our two newcomers, on entering the church, looked round in vain for places.  However, the old woman continued to move forwards. In vain were exclamations of displeasure vented against her from all sides: in vain was she addressed with "I assure you, Segnora, there are no places here," "I beg, Segnora, that you will not crowd me so intolerably!" "Segnora, you cannot pass this way. Bless me! How can people be so troublesome!"    The old woman was obstinate, and on she went. By dint of perseverance and two brawny arms she made a passage through the crowd, and managed to bustle herself into the very body of the church, at no great distance from the pulpit. Her companion had followed her with timidity and in silence, profiting by the exertions of her conductress.  "Holy Virgin!" exclaimed the old woman in a tone of disappointment, while she threw a glance of enquiry round her; "Holy Virgin! what heat! what a crowd! I wonder what can be the meaning of all this. I believe we must return: there is no such thing as a seat to be had, and nobody seems kind enough to accommodate us with theirs."

The former employed himself in calling every circumstance to his mind, which related might give Lorenzo's the most favourable idea of his connexion with Agnes. The latter, justly alarmed for the honour of his family, felt embarrassed by the presence of the marquis: the adventure which he had just witnessed forbad his treating him as a friend; and Antonia's interests being entrusted to his mediation, he saw the impolicy of treating him as a foe. He concluded from these    reflections, that profound silence would be the wisest plan, and waited with impatience for Don Raymond's explanation.  They arrived at the hotel de las Cisternas. The marquis immediately conducted him to his apartment, and began to express his satisfaction at finding him at Madrid. Lorenzo interrupted him.  "Excuse me, my lord," said he with a distant air, "if I reply somewhat coldly to your expressions of regard. A sister's honour is involved in this affair: till that is established, and the purport of your correspondence with Agnes cleared up, I cannot consider you as my friend. I am anxious to hear the meaning of your conduct; and hope that you will not delay the promised explanation."  "First give me your word, that you will listen with patience and indulgence."  "I love my sister too well to judge her harshly; and, till this moment, I possessed no friend so dear to me as yourself. I will also confess, that your having it in your power    to oblige me in a business which I have much at heart, makes me very anxious to find you still deserving my esteem."

Luckily, as I then thought, an opportunity presented itself of passing the night more agreeably than I expected. On mentioning my design of proceeding by myself to Strasbourg, the postillion shook his head in disapprobation.  "It is a long way," said he; "you will find it a difficult matter to arrive there without a guide: besides, monsieur seems unaccustomed to the season's severity; and 'tis possible that, unable to sustain the excessive cold "  "What use is there to present me with all these objections?" said I, impatiently interrupting him: "I have no other resource; I run still greater risk of perishing with cold by passing the night in the forest."  "Passing the night in the forest?" he replied. "Oh, by St. Denis! we are not in quite so bad a plight as that comes to yet. If I am not mistaken, we are scarcely five minutes walk from the cottage of my old friend    Baptiste: he is a wood-cutter, and a very honest fellow. I doubt not but he will shelter you for the night with pleasure. In the mean time, I can take the saddle-horse, ride to Strasbourg, and be back with proper people to mend your carriage by break of day."  "And, in the name of God," said I, "how could you leave me so long in suspense? Why did you not tell me of this cottage sooner? What excessive stupidity!"  "I thought, that perhaps monsieur would not deign to accept "

I fastened one of the sheets round his arms, and lowered him from the window. He flew to the stable, took Claude's horse, and hastened to Strasbourg. Had he been accosted by the banditti, he was to have declared himself sent upon a message by Baptiste, but fortunately he reached the town without meeting any obstacle. Immediately upon his arrival at Strasbourg, he entreated assistance from the magistrate: his story passed from mouth to mouth, and at length came to the knowledge of my lord the baron. Anxious for the safety of his lady, who he knew would be upon the road that evening, it struck him that she might have fallen into the power of the robbers. He accompanied Theodore, who guided the soldiers towards the cottage, and arrived just in time to save us from falling once more into the hands of our enemies."  Here I interrupted Marguerite to enquire why the sleepy potion had been presented to me. She said, that Baptiste supposed me to have arms about me, and    wished to incapacitate me from making resistance: it was a precaution which he always took, since, as the travellers had no hopes of escaping, despair would have incited them to sell their lives dearly.  The baron then desired Marguerite to inform him what were her present plans. I joined him in declaring my readiness to shew my gratitude to her for the preservation of my life.

The singularity of my adventure made me determine to conceal it from every one, since I could not expect that a circumstance so strange should gain credit. I was very uneasy about Agnes. I knew not what she would think at not finding me at the rendezvous,    and dreaded her entertaining suspicions of my fidelity. However, I depended upon Theodore's discretion, and trusted that my letter to the baroness would convince her of the rectitude of my intentions. These considerations somewhat lightened my inquietude upon her account; but the impression left upon my mind by my nocturnal visitor, grew stronger with every succeeding moment. The night drew near; I dreaded its arrival; yet I strove to persuade myself that the ghost would appear no more, and at all events I desired that a servant might sit up in my chamber.  The fatigue of my body, from not having slept on the former night, co-operating with the strong opiates administered to me in profusion, at length procured me that repose of which I was so much in need. I sunk into a profound and tranquil slumber, and had already slept for some hours, when the neighbouring clock roused me by striking "one." Its sound brought with it to my memory all the horrors of the night    before. The same cold shivering seized me. I started up in my bed, and perceived the servant fast asleep in an arm-chair near me. I called him by his name: he made no answer. I shook him forcibly by the arm, and strove in vain to wake him: he was perfectly insensible to my efforts. I now heard the heavy steps ascending the stair-case; the door was thrown open, and again the bleeding nun stood before me. Once more my limbs were chained in second infancy: once more I heard those fatal words repeated,  Raymond! Raymond! Thou art mine! 
LewiMMR.txt	211	2628000.0	1796	Lewis, M. G. (Matthew Gregory), 1775-1818	THE MONK: A ROMANCE.	"The domains of Lindenberg now fell to a distant relation. But terrified by the accounts given him of the bleeding nun [so    was the spectre called by the multitude] the new baron called to his assistance a celebrated exorciser. This holy man succeeded in obliging her to temporary repose: but though she discovered to him her history, he was not permitted to reveal it to others, or cause her skeleton to be removed to hallowed ground. That office was reserved for you; and till your coming her ghost was doomed to wander about the castle, and lament the crime which she had there committed. However, the exorciser obliged her to silence during his life-time. So long as he existed, the haunted chamber was shut up, and the spectre was invisible. At his death, which happened in five years after, she again appeared, but only once on every fifth year, on the same day and at the same hour when she plunged her knife in the heart of her sleeping lover: she then visited the cavern which held her mouldering skeleton, returned to the castle as soon as the clock struck two, and was seen no more till the next five years had elapsed.  "She was doomed to suffer during the space of a century. That period is past. Nothing now remains but to consign to the grave the ashes of Beatrice. I have been the means of releasing you from your visionary tormentor; and amidst all the sorrows which oppress me, to think that I have been of use to you, is some consolation. Youth, farewell! May the ghost of your relation enjoy that rest in the tomb, which the Almighty's vengeance has denied to me for ever!"

I endeavoured to detain her; but she disengaged herself from me with violence, and took refuge in the convent.  I retired, filled with confusion and inquietude. The next morning I failed not, as usual, to appear in the garden; but Agnes was no where to be seen. At night I waited for her at the place where we generally met. I found no better success. Several days and nights passed away in the same manner. At    length I saw my offended mistress cross the walk, on whose borders I was working: she was accompanied by the same young pensioner, on whose arm she seemed, from weakness, obliged to support herself. She looked upon me for a moment, but instantly turned her head away. I waited her return; but she passed on to the convent without paying any attention to me, or the penitent looks with which I implored her forgiveness.  As soon as the nuns were retired, the old gardener joined me with a sorrowful air.  "Segnor," said he, "it grieves me to say, that I can be no longer of use to you; the lady whom you used to meet has just assured me, that if I admitted you again into the garden, she would discover the whole business to the lady prioress. She bade me tell you also, that your presence was an insult, and that, if you still possess the least respect for her, you will never attempt to see her more. Excuse me then    for informing you, that I can favour your disguise no longer. Should the prioress be acquainted with my conduct, she might not be contented with dismissing me her service: out of revenge, she might accuse me of having profaned the convent, and cause me to be thrown into the prisons of the Inquisition."

A feather now of golden hue  He smiling from his pinion drew;  This to the poet's hand the boy commits;  And straight before Anacreaon's eyes  The fairest dreams of fancy rise,  And round his favoured head wild inspiration flits.      His bosom glows with amorous fire;  Eager he grasps the magic lyre;  Swift o'er the tuneful chords his fingers move:  The feather plucked from Cupid's wing  Sweeps the too-long neglected string,  While soft Anacreon sings the power and praise of love.      Soon as that name was heard, the woods  Shook off their snows; the melting floods  Broke their cold chains, and winter fled away.  Once more the earth was decked with flowers;  Mild zephyrs breathed through blooming bowers;  High towered the glorious sun, and poured then blaze of day.        Attracted by the harmonious sound,  Sylvans and fauns the cot surround,  And curious crowd the minstrel to behold:  The wood-nymphs haste the spell to prove;  Eager they run; they list, they love,  And, while they hear the strain, forget the man is old.      Cupid, to nothing constant long,  Perched on the harp attends the song,  Or stifles with a kiss the dulcet notes:  Now on the poet's breast reposes,  Now twines his hoary locks with roses,  Or borne on wings of gold in wanton circle floats.      Then thus Anacreon "I no more  At other shrines my vows will pour,  Since Cupid deigns my numbers to inspire:  From Phoebus or the blue-eyed maid  Now shall my verse request no aid,  For Love alone shall be the patron of my lyre.

Don Lorenzo, you forget in that pompous title the meanness of my origin.    You forget that I have now passed fourteen years in Spain, disavowed by my husband's family, and existing upon a stipend barely sufficient for the support and education of my daughter. Nay, I have even been neglected by most of my own relations, who out of envy affect to doubt the reality of my marriage. My allowance being discontinued at my father-in-law's death, I was reduced to the very brink of want. In this situation I was found by my sister, who, amongst all her foibles, possesses a warm, generous, and affectionate heart. She aided me with the little fortune which my father left her, persuaded me to visit Madrid, and has supported my child and myself since our quitting Murcia. Then, consider not Antonia as descended from the Condé de las Cisternas; consider her as a poor and unprotected orphan, as the grand-child of the tradesman Torribio Dalfa, as the needy pensioner of that tradesman's daughter. Reflect upon the difference between such a situation and that of the nephew and heir of the potent    duke of Medina. I believe your intentions to be honourable; but as there are no hopes that your uncle will approve of the union, I foresee that the consequences of your attachment must be fatal to my child's repose."

Antonia spoke of her mother's health with all the enthusiastic joy of a youthful heart.  "I admire your filial affection," said the abbot; "it proves the excellence and sensibility of your character; it promises a treasure to him whom Heaven has destined to possess your affections. The breast so capable of fondness for a parent, what will it feel for a lover? Nay, perhaps, what feels it for one even now? Tell me, my lovely daughter, have you known what it is to love? Answer me with sincerity: forget my habit, and consider me only as a friend."  "What it is to love?" said she, repeating his question. "Oh! yes, undoubtedly; I have loved many, many people."  "That is not what I mean. The love of which I speak can be felt only for one.    Have you never seen the man whom you wished to be your husband?"  "Oh! no, indeed!"  This was an untruth, but she was unconscious of its falsehood: she knew not the nature of her sentiments for Lorenzo; and never having seen him since his first visit to Elvira, with every day his image grew less feebly impressed upon her bosom: besides, she thought of a husband with all a virgin's terror, and negatived the friar's demand without a moment's hesitation.

The taper, now burnt down to the socket, sometimes flaring upwards, shot a gleam of light through the room, then sinking again seemed upon the point of expiring. Antonia's heart throbbed with agitation; her eyes wandered fearfully over the objects around her, as the trembling flame illuminated them at intervals. She attempted to rise from her seat, but her limbs trembled so violently that she was unable to proceed. She then called Flora, who was in a room at no great distance; but agitation choked    her voice, and her cries died away in hollow murmurs.  She passed some minutes in this situation, after which her terrors began to diminish. She strove to recover herself, and acquire strength enough to quit the room. Suddenly she fancied that she heard a low sigh drawn near her. This idea brought back her former weakness. She had already raised herself from her seat, and was on the point of taking the lamp from the table. The imaginary noise stopped her; she drew back her hand, and supported herself upon the back of a chair. She listened anxiously, but nothing more was heard.  "Gracious God!" she said to herself, "what could be that sound? Was I deceived, or did I really hear it?"

He lifted her, still motionless, from the tomb: he seated himself upon a bank of stone, and, supporting her in his arms, watched impatiently for the symptoms of returning animation. Scarcely could he command his passions sufficiently, to restrain himself from enjoying her while yet insensible. His natural lust was increased in ardour by the difficulties which had opposed his satisfying it; as also by his long abstinence from woman, since, from the moment of resigning her claim to his love, Matilda had exiled him from her arms for ever.  "I am no prostitute, Ambrosio," had she told him, when, in the fullness of his lust, he demanded her favours with more than usual earnestness; "I am now no more than your friend, and will not be your mistress.    Cease then to solicit my complying with desires which insult me. While your heart was mine, I gloried in your embraces. Those happy times are past; my person is become indifferent to you, and 'tis necessity, not love, which makes you seek my enjoyment. I cannot yield to a request so humiliating to my pride."  Suddenly deprived of pleasures, the use of which had made them an absolute want, the monk felt this restraint severely. Naturally addicted to the gratification of the senses, in the full vigour of manhood and heat of blood, he had suffered his temperament to acquire such ascendency, that his lust was become madness. Of his fondness for Antonia, none but the grosser particles remained; he longed for the possession of her person; and even the gloom of the vault, the surrounding silence, and the resistance which he expected from her, seemed to give a fresh edge to his fierce and unbridled desires.

As I threw a look of terror round my prison, as I shrunk from the cutting wind which howled through my subterraneous dwelling, the change seemed so striking, so abrupt, that I doubted its reality. That the duke de Medina's niece, that the destined bride of the marquis de las Cisternas, one bred up in affluence, related to the noblest families in Spain, and rich in a multitude of affectionate friends that she should in one moment become a captive, separated from the world for ever, weighed down with chains, and reduced to support life with the coarsest aliments appeared a change so sudden and incredible, that I believed myself the sport of some frightful vision. Its continuance convinced me of    my mistake with but too much certainty. Every morning I looked for some relief from my sufferings: every morning my hopes were disappointed. At length I abandoned all idea of escaping, I resigned myself to my fate, and only expected liberty when she came the companion of death.  My mental anguish, and the dreadful scenes in which I had been an actress, advanced the period of my labour. In solitude and misery, abandoned by all, unassisted by art, uncomforted by friendship, with pangs which if witnessed would have touched the hardest heart, was I delivered of my wretched burthen. It came alive into the world; but I knew not how to treat it, or by what means to preserve its existence. I could only bathe it with tears, warm it in my bosom, and offer up prayers for its safety. I was soon deprived of this mournful employment: the want of proper attendance, my ignorance how to nurse it, the bitter cold of the dungeon, and the unwholesome    air which inflated its lungs, terminated my sweet babe's short and painful existence. It expired in a few hours after its birth, and I witnessed its death with agonies which beggar all description.

The fiend answered by a malicious laugh:  "Our contract? Have I not performed my part? What more did I promise than to    save you from your prison? Have I not done so? Are you not safe from the Inquisition safe from all but from me? Fool that you were to confide yourself to a devil! Why did you not stipulate for life, and power, and pleasure? Then all would have been granted: now, your reflections come too late. Miscreant, prepare for death; you have not many hours to live!"  On hearing this sentence, dreadful were the feelings of the devoted wretch! He sank upon his knees, and raised his hands towards heaven. The fiend read his intention, and prevented it  "What?" he cried, darting at him a look of fury: "Dare you still implore the Eternal's mercy? Would you feign penitence, and again act an hypocrite's part? Villain, resign your hopes of pardon. Thus I secure my prey!"  As he said this, darting his talons into the monk's shaven crown, he sprang with him from the rock. The caves and mountains rang with Ambrosio's shrieks. The daemon    continued to soar aloft, till reaching a dreadful height, he released the sufferer. Headlong fell the monk through the airy waste; the sharp point of a rock received him; and he rolled from precipice to precipice, till, bruised and mangled, he rested on the river's banks.

Life still existed in his miserable frame: he attempted in vain to raise himself; his broken and dislocated limbs refused to perform their office, nor was he able to quit the spot where he had first fallen. The sun now rose above the horizon; its scorching beams darted full upon the head of the expiring sinner. Myriads of infects were called forth by the warmth; they drank the blood which trickled from Ambrosio's wounds; he had no power to drive them from him, and they fastened upon his sores, darted their stings into his body, covered him with their multitudes, and inflicted on him tortures the most exquisite and insupportable. The eagles of the rock tore his flesh piecemeal, and dug out his eye-balls with their crooked    beaks. A burning thirst tormented him; he heard the river's murmur as it rolled beside him, but strove in vain to drag himself towards the sound. Blind, maimed, helpless, and despairing, venting his rage in blasphemy and curses, execrating his existence, yet dreading the arrival of death destined to yield him up to greater torments, six miserable days did the villain languish. On the seventh a violent storm arose: the winds in fury rent up rocks and forests: the sky was now black with clouds, now sheeted with fire: the rain fell in torrents; it swelled the stream; the waves overflowed their banks; they reached the spot where Ambrosio lay, and, when they abated, carried with them into the river the corse of the despairing monk.

janeeyre.txt	0	1440.0	1847	Bronte, Charlotte	Jane Eyre	CHAPTER I      There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been  wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but  since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold  winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so  penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question.    I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly  afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with  nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie,  the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to  Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.    The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama  in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with  her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying)  looked perfectly happy. Me, she had dispensed from joining the group;  saying, "She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a  distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her  own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a  more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly  manner--something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were--she really  must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy,  little children."    "What does Bessie say I have done?" I asked.

Be  seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent."    A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there. It  contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care  that it should be one stored with pictures. I mounted into the window-  seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having  drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double  retirement.    Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left  were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the  drear November day. At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my  book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon. Afar, it offered a  pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat  shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and  lamentable blast.    I returned to my book--Bewick's History of British Birds: the letterpress  thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were  certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite  as a blank. They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of  "the solitary rocks and promontories" by them only inhabited; of the  coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity, the  Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape--    "Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,  Boils round the naked, melancholy isles  Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge  Pours in among the stormy Hebrides."

They ought to have come a little sooner to have heard  his lecture on dress, for they were splendidly attired in velvet, silk,  and furs. The two younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and  seventeen) had grey beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich  plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a  profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled; the elder lady was  enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with ermine, and she wore a  false front of French curls.    These ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple, as Mrs. and the  Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the  room. It seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend  relative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room  upstairs, while he transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned  the laundress, and lectured the superintendent. They now proceeded to  address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who was charged with  the care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories: but I had no  time to listen to what they said; other matters called off and enchanted  my attention. 
janeeyre.txt	184	3.0	1847	Bronte, Charlotte	Jane Eyre	When  I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round and listened, with  an idea that a horse's hoofs might ring on the causeway again, and that a  rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland dog, might be again  apparent: I saw only the hedge and a pollard willow before me, rising up  still and straight to meet the moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft  of wind roaming fitful among the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant;  and when I glanced down in the direction of the murmur, my eye,  traversing the hall-front, caught a light kindling in a window: it  reminded me that I was late, and I hurried on.    I did not like re-entering Thornfield. To pass its threshold was to  return to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome  staircase, to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet tranquil  Mrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her, and her only,  was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk,--to slip  again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too still  existence; of an existence whose very privileges of security and ease I  was becoming incapable of appreciating. What good it would have done me  at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain struggling  life, and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience to long for  the calm amidst which I now repined! Yes, just as much good as it would  do a man tired of sitting still in a "too easy chair" to take a long  walk: and just as natural was the wish to stir, under my circumstances,  as it would be under his. 
janeeyre.txt	200	2.0	1847	Bronte, Charlotte	Jane Eyre	  "Were you happy when you painted these pictures?" asked Mr. Rochester  presently.    "I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy. To paint them, in short, was  to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known."    "That is not saying much. Your pleasures, by your own account, have been  few; but I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist's dreamland while  you blent and arranged these strange tints. Did you sit at them long  each day?"    "I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and I sat at them  from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of the  midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply."    "And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent labours?"    "Far from it. I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my  handiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was quite  powerless to realise."    "Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no more,  probably. You had not enough of the artist's skill and science to give  it full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar. As to  the thoughts, they are elfish. These eyes in the Evening Star you must  have seen in a dream. How could you make them look so clear, and yet not  at all brilliant? for the planet above quells their rays. And what  meaning is that in their solemn depth? And who taught you to paint wind? 
janeeyre.txt	257	14400.0	1847	Bronte, Charlotte	Jane Eyre	  Ere long, I had reason to congratulate myself on the course of wholesome  discipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit. Thanks to  it, I was able to meet subsequent occurrences with a decent calm, which,  had they found me unprepared, I should probably have been unequal to  maintain, even externally.          CHAPTER XVII      A week passed, and no news arrived of Mr. Rochester: ten days, and still  he did not come. Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be surprised if he  were to go straight from the Leas to London, and thence to the Continent,  and not show his face again at Thornfield for a year to come; he had not  unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite as abrupt and unexpected. When  I heard this, I was beginning to feel a strange chill and failing at the  heart. I was actually permitting myself to experience a sickening sense  of disappointment; but rallying my wits, and recollecting my principles,  I at once called my sensations to order; and it was wonderful how I got  over the temporary blunder--how I cleared up the mistake of supposing Mr. 
janeeyre.txt	355	10080.0	1847	Bronte, Charlotte	Jane Eyre	And signs, for aught we know, may be but the sympathies of Nature with  man.    When I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night heard Bessie  Leaven say to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a little  child; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, either  to one's self or one's kin. The saying might have worn out of my memory,  had not a circumstance immediately followed which served indelibly to fix  it there. The next day Bessie was sent for home to the deathbed of her  little sister.    Of late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during  the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not  brought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my  arms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing with  daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling its hands in running water. It was  a wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next: now it nestled  close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever mood the apparition  evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven successive  nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber. 
janeeyre.txt	358	2.0	1847	Bronte, Charlotte	Jane Eyre	  I was silent: the things were frightful. Robert Leaven resumed--    "Missis had been out of health herself for some time: she had got very  stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of  poverty were quite breaking her down. The information about Mr. John's  death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke. She  was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather  better: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making  signs to my wife and mumbling. It was only yesterday morning, however,  that Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and at last she  made out the words, 'Bring Jane--fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to  her.' Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or means  anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and  advised them to send for you. The young ladies put it off at first; but  their mother grew so restless, and said, 'Jane, Jane,' so many times,  that at last they consented. I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can  get ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow  morning."    "Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought to go."    "I think so too, Miss. Bessie said she was sure you would not refuse:  but I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?" 
janeeyre.txt	561	25.0	1847	Bronte, Charlotte	Jane Eyre	  On a chair by the bedside were all my own things, clean and dry. My  black silk frock hung against the wall. The traces of the bog were  removed from it; the creases left by the wet smoothed out: it was quite  decent. My very shoes and stockings were purified and rendered  presentable. There were the means of washing in the room, and a comb and  brush to smooth my hair. After a weary process, and resting every five  minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself. My clothes hung loose on me;  for I was much wasted, but I covered deficiencies with a shawl, and once  more, clean and respectable looking--no speck of the dirt, no trace of  the disorder I so hated, and which seemed so to degrade me, left--I crept  down a stone staircase with the aid of the banisters, to a narrow low  passage, and found my way presently to the kitchen.    It was full of the fragrance of new bread and the warmth of a generous  fire. Hannah was baking. Prejudices, it is well known, are most  difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened  or fertilised by education: they grow there, firm as weeds among stones.  Hannah had been cold and stiff, indeed, at the first: latterly she had  begun to relent a little; and when she saw me come in tidy and  well-dressed, she even smiled.

Diana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the day approached  for leaving their brother and their home. They both tried to appear as  usual; but the sorrow they had to struggle against was one that could not  be entirely conquered or concealed. Diana intimated that this would be a  different parting from any they had ever yet known. It would probably,  as far as St. John was concerned, be a parting for years: it might be a  parting for life.    "He will sacrifice all to his long-framed resolves," she said: "natural  affection and feelings more potent still. St. John looks quiet, Jane;  but he hides a fever in his vitals. You would think him gentle, yet in  some things he is inexorable as death; and the worst of it is, my  conscience will hardly permit me to dissuade him from his severe  decision: certainly, I cannot for a moment blame him for it. It is  right, noble, Christian: yet it breaks my heart!" And the tears gushed  to her fine eyes. Mary bent her head low over her work.    "We are now without father: we shall soon be without home and brother,"  she murmured. 
janeeyre.txt	595	8.0	1847	Bronte, Charlotte	Jane Eyre	  Having brought my eventide musings to this point, I rose, went to my  door, and looked at the sunset of the harvest-day, and at the quiet  fields before my cottage, which, with the school, was distant half a mile  from the village. The birds were singing their last strains--    "The air was mild, the dew was balm."    While I looked, I thought myself happy, and was surprised to find myself  ere long weeping--and why? For the doom which had reft me from adhesion  to my master: for him I was no more to see; for the desperate grief and  fatal fury--consequences of my departure--which might now, perhaps, be  dragging him from the path of right, too far to leave hope of ultimate  restoration thither. At this thought, I turned my face aside from the  lovely sky of eve and lonely vale of Morton--I say _lonely_, for in that  bend of it visible to me there was no building apparent save the church  and the parsonage, half-hid in trees, and, quite at the extremity, the  roof of Vale Hall, where the rich Mr. Oliver and his daughter lived. I  hid my eyes, and leant my head against the stone frame of my door; but  soon a slight noise near the wicket which shut in my tiny garden from the  meadow beyond it made me look up. A dog--old Carlo, Mr. Rivers' pointer,  as I saw in a moment--was pushing the gate with his nose, and St. John  himself leant upon it with folded arms; his brow knit, his gaze, grave  almost to displeasure, fixed on me. I asked him to come in. 
janeeyre.txt	603	2.0	1847	Bronte, Charlotte	Jane Eyre	Flushed and kindled thus, he looked nearly as beautiful for a man as she  for a woman. His chest heaved once, as if his large heart, weary of  despotic constriction, had expanded, despite the will, and made a  vigorous bound for the attainment of liberty. But he curbed it, I think,  as a resolute rider would curb a rearing steed. He responded neither by  word nor movement to the gentle advances made him.    "Papa says you never come to see us now," continued Miss Oliver, looking  up. "You are quite a stranger at Vale Hall. He is alone this evening,  and not very well: will you return with me and visit him?"    "It is not a seasonable hour to intrude on Mr. Oliver," answered St.  John.    "Not a seasonable hour! But I declare it is. It is just the hour when  papa most wants company: when the works are closed and he has no business  to occupy him. Now, Mr. Rivers, _do_ come. Why are you so very shy, and  so very sombre?" She filled up the hiatus his silence left by a reply of  her own.    "I forgot!" she exclaimed, shaking her beautiful curled head, as if  shocked at herself. "I am so giddy and thoughtless! _Do_ excuse me. It  had slipped my memory that you have good reasons to be indisposed for  joining in my chatter. Diana and Mary have left you, and Moor House is  shut up, and you are so lonely. I am sure I pity you. Do come and see  papa." 
janeeyre.txt	699	120.0	1847	Bronte, Charlotte	Jane Eyre	  It wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time. I filled the interval in  walking softly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had  given my plans their present bent. I recalled that inward sensation I  had experienced: for I could recall it, with all its unspeakable  strangeness. I recalled the voice I had heard; again I questioned whence  it came, as vainly as before: it seemed in _me_--not in the external  world. I asked was it a mere nervous impression--a delusion? I could  not conceive or believe: it was more like an inspiration. The wondrous  shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the foundations  of Paul and Silas's prison; it had opened the doors of the soul's cell  and loosed its bands--it had wakened it out of its sleep, whence it  sprang trembling, listening, aghast; then vibrated thrice a cry on my  startled ear, and in my quaking heart and through my spirit, which  neither feared nor shook, but exulted as if in joy over the success of  one effort it had been privileged to make, independent of the cumbrous  body.    "Ere many days," I said, as I terminated my musings, "I will know  something of him whose voice seemed last night to summon me. Letters  have proved of no avail--personal inquiry shall replace them."    At breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going a journey,  and should be absent at least four days.    "Alone, Jane?" they asked. 
janeeyre.txt	707	2.0	1847	Bronte, Charlotte	Jane Eyre	  "Is Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall now?" I asked, knowing, of  course, what the answer would be, but yet desirous of deferring the  direct question as to where he really was.    "No, ma'am--oh, no! No one is living there. I suppose you are a  stranger in these parts, or you would have heard what happened last  autumn,--Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: it was burnt down just about  harvest-time. A dreadful calamity! such an immense quantity of valuable  property destroyed: hardly any of the furniture could be saved. The fire  broke out at dead of night, and before the engines arrived from Millcote,  the building was one mass of flame. It was a terrible spectacle: I  witnessed it myself."    "At dead of night!" I muttered. Yes, that was ever the hour of fatality  at Thornfield. "Was it known how it originated?" I demanded.    "They guessed, ma'am: they guessed. Indeed, I should say it was  ascertained beyond a doubt. You are not perhaps aware," he continued,  edging his chair a little nearer the table, and speaking low, "that there  was a lady--a--a lunatic, kept in the house?"    "I have heard something of it."    "She was kept in very close confinement, ma'am: people even for some  years was not absolutely certain of her existence. No one saw her: they  only knew by rumour that such a person was at the Hall; and who or what  she was it was difficult to conjecture. They said Mr. Edward had brought  her from abroad, and some believed she had been his mistress. But a  queer thing happened a year since--a very queer thing."

He cannot now see very distinctly: he cannot read or write much; but he can find his way without being led by the hand: the sky is no longer a blank to him--the earth no longer a void.  When his first-born was put into his arms, he could see that the boy had inherited his own eyes, as they once were--large, brilliant, and black.  On that occasion, he again, with a full heart, acknowledged that God had tempered judgment with mercy. My Edward and I, then, are happy: and the more so, because those we most love are happy likewise.  Diana and Mary Rivers are both married: alternately, once every year, they come to see us, and we go to see them. Diana's husband is a captain in the navy, a gallant officer and a good man.  Mary's is a clergyman, a college friend of her brother's, and, from his attainments and principles, worthy of the connection.  Both Captain Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton love their wives, and are loved by them. As to St. John Rivers, he left England: he went to India.  He entered on the path he had marked for himself; he pursues it still.  A more resolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dangers.
janeeyre.txt	750	525600.0	1847	Bronte, Charlotte	Jane Eyre	Firm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he  labours for his race; he clears their painful way to improvement; he hews  down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber it. He  may be stern; he may be exacting; he may be ambitious yet; but his is the  sternness of the warrior Greatheart, who guards his pilgrim convoy from  the onslaught of Apollyon. His is the exaction of the apostle, who  speaks but for Christ, when he says--"Whosoever will come after me, let  him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me." His is the  ambition of the high master-spirit, which aims to fill a place in the  first rank of those who are redeemed from the earth--who stand without  fault before the throne of God, who share the last mighty victories of  the Lamb, who are called, and chosen, and faithful.    St. John is unmarried: he never will marry now. Himself has hitherto  sufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its close: his glorious sun  hastens to its setting. The last letter I received from him drew from my  eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with divine joy: he anticipated  his sure reward, his incorruptible crown. I know that a stranger's hand  will write to me next, to say that the good and faithful servant has been  called at length into the joy of his Lord. And why weep for this? No  fear of death will darken St. John's last hour: his mind will be  unclouded, his heart will be undaunted, his hope will be sure, his faith  steadfast. His own words are a pledge of this--    "My Master," he says, "has forewarned me. Daily He announces more  distinctly,--'Surely I come quickly!' and hourly I more eagerly  respond,--'Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus!'"

THE HISTORY OF Sir CHARLES GRANDISON, Bart.    LETTER I. Miss LUCY SELBY, To Miss HARRIET BYRON.  Ashby-Canons, January 10.  YOUR resolution to accompany Mrs. Reeves to London, has greatly alarmed your three Lovers. And two of them, at least, will let you know that it has. Such a lovely girl as my Harriet, must expect to be more accountable for her steps than one less excellent and less attractive.  Mr. Greville, in his usual resolute way, threatens to follow you to London; and there, he says, he will watch the motions of every man who approaches you; and, if he find reason for it, will early let such man know his pretensions, and the danger he may run into, if he pretend to be his competitor. But let me not do him injustice; though he talks of a rival thus harshly, he speaks of you more highly than man ever spoke of woman. Angel and Goddess are phrases you have been used to from him; and tho' spoken in    his humorous way, yet I am sure he most sincerely admires you.  Mr. Fenwick, in a less determined manner, declares, that he will follow you to town, if you stay there above one fortnight.  The gentle Orme sighs his apprehensions, and wishes you would change your purpose. Tho' hopeless, he says, it is some pleasure to him, that he can think himself in the same county with you; and much more, that he can tread in your footsteps to and from church every Sunday, and behold you there. He wonders how your grandmamma, your aunt, your uncle, can spare you. Your cousin Reeves's surely, he says, are very happy in their influences over us all.

Each of the gentlemen is afraid, that by increasing the number of your admirers, you will increase his difficulties: But what is that to them, I asked, when they already know, that you are not inclined to favour any of the three?  If you hold your resolution, and my cousin Reeves's their time of setting out, pray let me know, and I will attend you at my uncle Selby's, to wish you a good journey, much pleasure in town, and a return with a safe and sound heart. My sister, who, poor dear girl, continues extremely weak and low, will spare me for a purpose so indispensable. I will not have you come to us. I know it would grieve you to see her in the way she is in. You too much take to heart the infirmities of your friends which you cannot cure; and as your grandmamma lives upon your smiles, and you rejoice all your friends by your chearfulness, it would be cruel to make you sad.  MR. GREVILLE has just left us. He dropt in upon us as we were going to dinner. My grandmother Selby you know is always pleased with his rattling. She prevailed on him to alight, and sit down with us. All his talk was of you. He repeated his    former threatenings (as I called them to him) on your going to town. After dinner, he read us a Letter from Lady Frampton relating to you.

And by whom? Have I written any thing so very blazing! Surely I have not. But you should not say you will all forgive me, if this be my sad situation. You should not say, How much you are yourselves, all of you, in love with this excellent man; and talk of Mr. Dawson, and of what he says of him: But you should have told me, that if I suffer my gratitude to grow into Love, you will never forgive me; then should I have had a call of duty to check or controul a passion, that you were afraid could not be gratified.  Well, and there is no way left me, it seems, but to fly for it! To hurry away to Northamptonshire, and either to begin a new treaty with Lord D. or to give hope to an old Lover. Poor Harriet Byron!

Let me alone, Harriet: Now a quarrel; now a reconciliation; I warrant I shall be happier than any of the yawning see-saws in the kingdom. Everlasting summers would be a grievance.  Harriet. You may be right, if you are exceeding discreet in your perversenesses, Charlotte; and yet if    you are, you will not lay out for a quarrel, I fansy. The world, or you will have better luck than your brother seems to have had, will find you opportunities enow, for exercising the tempers of both, without your needing to study for occasions.  Miss Gr. Study for them, Harriet! I sha'n't study for them, neither: They will come of course.  Harriet. I was about to ask a question But 'tis better let alone.  Miss Gr. I will have it. What was your question? Don't you see what a good-natured fool I am? You may say any-thing to me: I won't be angry.  Harriet. I was going to ask you, If you were ever concernd two hours together, for any fault you ever committed in your life?

I walked by the side of it, and in this manner moved towards Cremona, in order to shorten the way of the expected surgeon.  My servant soon returned with one. Jeronymo had sainted away. The surgeon dressed him, and proceeded with him to Cremona. Then it was, that, opening his eyes, he beheld, and knew me; and being told, by the sugeon, that he owed his preservation to me, O Grandison! said he, that I had followed your advice! that I had kept my promise with you! How did I insult you! Can my deliverer forgive me? You shall be the director of my future life, if it please God to restore me.  His wounds proved not mortal; but he never will be the man he was: Partly from his having been unskilfully treated by this his first surgeon; and partly from his own impatience, and the difficulty of curing the wound in his hip-joint. Excuse this particularity, madam. The subject requires it; and Signor Jeronymo now deserves it, and all your pity.  I attended him at Cremona, till he was fit to remove. He was visited there by his whole family from Bologna. There never was a family more affectionate to one another: The suffering of one, is the suffering of every one. The Barone was exceedingly beloved by his father, mother, sister, for the sweetness of his manners, his affectionate heart, and a wit so delightfully gay and lively, that his company was sought by every-body.

The daughters are remarkable for their piety, patience, good oeconomy, and prudence. They are the most dutiful of children, and most affectionate of sisters. They were for three years the support of their father's spirits, and have always been the consolation of their mother. They lost their father about four years ago: And it is even edifying to observe▪ how elegantly they support the family reputation in their fine old mansion house by the prudent management of their little income; for the matter leaves every houshold care to them; and they make it a rule to conclude the year with discharging every demand that    can be made upon them, and to commence the new year absolutely clear of the world, and with some cash in hand; yet were brought up in affluence, and to the expectation of handsome fortunes; for, besides that they could have no thought of losing their cause, they had very great and reasonable prospects from Mr Calvert, an uncle by their mother's side; who was rich in money, and had besides an estate in land of 1500 l. a year.

Upon some occasion, Lady G. reflected upon a Lady for prudery; and was going on, when Sir Charles, interrupting her, said, Take care, Lady G. You, Ladies, take care; for I am afraid that MODESTY, under this name, will become ignominious, and be banished the hearts, at least the behaviour and conversation, of all those whose fortunes or inclinations carry them often to places of public resort.  Talk of places of public resort! said Lord L.; It is vexatious to observe at such, how men of real merit are neglected by the fine Ladies of the age, while every distinction is shewn to fops and foplings.  But, who, my Lord, said Sir Charles, are those women? Are they not generally of a class with those men? Flippant women love empty men, because they cannot reproach them with a superiority of understanding, but keep their solly in countenance. They are afraid of a wise man: But I would by no means have such a one turn sool to please them: For they will despise the wise man's folly more than the silly man's, and with reason; because being uncharacteristic, it must sit more aukwardly upon him than the others can do.  Yet wisdom itself, and the truest wisdom, goodness, said Mrs. Reeves, is sometimes thought to sit ungracefully, when it is uncharacteristic, not to the man, but to the times. She then named a person who was branded as an hypocrite, for performing all his duties publicly.

Hence it was concluded, that she would take some notice of me when she saw me; and I was led    by the General, followed by the rest, into the Marchioness's drawing-room.  Father Marescotti had given me an advantageous character of the General's Lady, whom I had not yet seen. The Bishop had told me, that she was such another excellent woman as his mother, and, like her, had the Italian reserve softened by a polite French education, The Marquis, the Count, Father Marescotti, and this real fine Lady, were in the drawingroom. The General presented me to her. I do not, madam, bid you admire the Chevalier Grandison: But I forgive you if you do; because you will not be able to do otherwise.  My Lord, said she, you told me an hour ago, that I must: And now, that I see the Chevalier, you will have no cause to reproach me with disobedience.  I bowed on her hand. Father Marescotti, madam, said I, bid me expect from the Lady of the young Marchese della Porretta every-thing that was condescending and good. Your compassionate Love for an unhappy new sister, who deserves every-one's Love, exalts your character.  Father Marescotti came in. We took our places. It was designed, I found, to try to revive the young Lady's attention, by introducing her in full assembly, I one of it. But I could not forbear asking the Marchioness, if Lady Clementina would not be too much startled at so much company?

Not a word did my brother speak of his intention, till he received that Letter; and then he invited Lady L. and me, and our two honest men, to afternoon tea with him [O but I have not reckoned with you for your saucy rebukes in your last of the 7th; I owe you a spite for it; and, Harriet, depend on payment What was I writing? I have it ] And when tea was over, he, without a blush, without looking down, as a girl would do in this situation [But why so, Harriet? Is a woman, on these occasions, to act a part as if she supposed herself to be the greatest gainer by    matrimony; and therefore was ashamed of consenting to accept of an honourable offer? As if, in other words, she was to be the self-denying receiver rather than conferrer of an obligation? Lord, how we rambling-headed creatures break in upon ourselves!] with a good grace he told us of his intention to marry; of his apparition to Mrs. Shirley; of his sudden vanishing; and all that And then he produced Mrs. Shirley's Letter, but just received.  And do you think we were not overjoyed? Indeed we were. We congratulated him: We congratulated each other: Lord L. looked as he did when Caroline gave him his happy day: Lord G. could not keep his seat: He was tipsy, poor man, with his joy: Aunt Nell prank'd herself, stroked her ribbands of pink and yellow, and chuckled and mumped for joy, that her nephew at last would not go out of Old England for a wife. She was mightily pleased too with Mrs. Shirley's Letter. It was just such a one as she herself would have written upon the occasion.

I have not yet been able to break to her the daily expectation I have of seeing in England her parents and brothers: Yet am uneasy, that she knows it not. I want courage, my Harriet, to acquaint her with it. I have more than once essayed to do it. Dear creature! she looks with so much innocence, and so much reliance upon me; and is, at times, so apprehensive! I know not how to break it to her.  She depends upon my mediation. She urges me to begin a treaty of reconciliation with them. I defer writing, I tell her, till I have seen Mrs. Beaumont.    Little does she think they are upon their journey, and that I know not where to direct to them. She longs for Mrs. Beaumont's arrival; and hopes, she says, she will bring with her the poor Camilla, that she may have an opportunity to obtain her excuse for the harsh treatment she gave her: And yet Camilla, said she, was a teazing woman.  Were you ever sensible, my Harriet, of the tender pain that an open heart (yours is an open and an enlarged one) feels; longing, yet, for its friend's sake, afraid, to reveal unwelcome tidings, which, however, it imports the concerned to know? How loth to disturb the tranquillity which is built upon ignorance of the event! Yet that every tranquillity (contemplated upon) adding to the pain of the compassionating friend; who reflects, that when the unhappy news shall be revealed, Time, and Christian philosophy, only, will ever restore it to the heart of the sufferer!

This is what I stole time to write, while Sir Charles is engaged in discourse with the Lady, and our guests are preparing to be gone to Lord G's, Lady G. requesting my aunt's company early. She is the veriest coward! These brave spirits, she has said, are but flash. Indeed the very delicate, as well as very serious, and even solemn, circumstances, which attend her case, must make the liveliest woman, when the time approaches, think! The inclosed note of hers to my aunt, brought late last night, is, however, in her usual stile:  YOU and Lucy must be here early To-morrow morning.  What wretched simpletons are we women! Daughters of gewgaw, solly, ostentation, trifle! First, we shew our sorry fellow, when not disapproved, to our friends and relations; and take all their judgments    upon him. If he has their opinion in his favour, every-body, be he what he will, will praise him; and give him riches, sense, ancestry, and I cannot tell what of qualities that perhaps we shall never find out. Then we shew our presents, our jewels, our laces; and a smile spreads the mouth, and a sparkle gladdens the eye, of every maiden that hangs admiring over them. Ah, filly maidens! if you could look three yards from your noses, you would pity, instead of envying, the milk-white heifer dressed in ribbands, and just ready to be led to sacrifice.

Poor Sir Hargrave Pollexfen! May he have met with mercy from the All-merciful!  He gave his will into Sir Charles's hands, soon after he came down. He has made him his sole executor. Have you not been told, that Sir Charles had heretofore reconciled him to his relations and heirs at Law? He had the pleasure of finding the reconciliation sincere. The poor man spoke kindly to them all. They were tenderly careful of him. He acknowleged their care.  I cannot write for tears. The poor man, in the last solemn act of his life, has been intendedly kind, but really cruel, to me. I should have been a sincere mourner for him (A life so mispent!) without this act of regard for me He has left me, as a small atonement, he calls it, for the terrors he once gave me, a very large Legacy in money (Sir Charles has not yet told me what) and his jewels and plate And he has left Sir Charles a noble one besides. He died immensely rich. Sir Charles is grieved at both Legacies: And the more, as he cannot give them back to the heirs; for they declare, that he bound them under a solemn oath (and by a curse, if they broke it) not to except back either from Sir Charles, or me, the large bequests he told them he had made us: And they assured Sir Charles, that they would be religiously bound by it.

Many unhappy objects will be the better for these bequests. Sir Charles tells me, that he will not interfere, no, not so much as by his advice, in the disposal of mine. You, madam, and my aunt Selby, must direct me, when it comes into my hands. Sir Charles intends, that the poor man's memory shall receive true honour from the disposition of his Legacy to him. He is pleased with his Harriet, for the concern she expressed for this unhappy man.    The most indulgent of husbands finds out some reason to praise her for every thing she says and does. But could HE be otherwise than the best of HUSBANDS, who was the most dutiful of SONS; who is the most affectionate of BROTHERS; the most faithful of FRIENDS: Who is good upon principle, in every relation of life?  What, my dear grandmamma, is the boasted character of most of those who are called HEROES, to the un-ostentatious merit of a TRULY GOOD MAN? In what a variety of amiable lights does such a one appear? In how many ways is he a blessing and a joy to his fellow-creatures?  And this blessing, this joy, your Harriet can call more peculiarly her own!  My single heart, methinks, is not big enough to contain the gratitude which such a Lot demands. Let the overflowings of your pious joy, my dearest grandmamma, join with my thankfulness in paying part of the immense debt for  Your undeservedly Happy  HARRIET GRANDISON. 
SteinJGW.txt	0	30240.0	1939	Steinbeck, John	The grapes of wrath	    Chapter 1    TO THE RED COUNTRY and part of the gray country of Oklahoma, the last rains came gently, and they did not cut the scarred earth. The plows crossed and recrossed the rivulet marks. The last rains lifted the corn quickly and scattered weed colonies and grass along the sides of the roads so that the gray country and the dark red country began to disappear under a green cover. In the last part of May the sky grew pale and the clouds that had hung in high puffs for so long in the spring were dissipated. The sun flared down on the growing corn day after day until a line of brown spread along the edge of each green bayonet. The clouds appeared, and went away, and in a while they did not try any more. The weeds grew darker green to protect themselves, and they did not spread any more. The surface of the earth crusted, a thin hard crust, and as the sky became pale, so the earth became pale, pink in the red country and white in the gray country.    In the water-cut gullies the earth dusted down in dry little streams. Gophers and ant lions started small avalanches. And as the sharp sun struck day after day, the leaves of the young corn became less stiff and erect; they bent in a curve at first, and then, as the central ribs of strength grew weak, each leaf tilted downward. Then it was June, and the sun shone more fiercely. The brown lines on the corn leaves widened and moved in on the central ribs. The weeds frayed and edged back toward their roots. The air was thin and the sky more pale; and every day the earth paled. 
SteinJGW.txt	1	20160.0	1939	Steinbeck, John	The grapes of wrath	  In the roads where the teams moved, where the wheels milled the ground and the hooves of the horses beat the ground, the dirt crust broke and the dust formed. Every moving thing lifted the dust into the air: a walking man lifted a thin layer as high as his waist, and a wagon lifted the dust as high as the fence tops, and an automobile boiled a cloud behind it. The dust was long in settling back again.    When June was half gone, the big clouds moved up out of Texas and the Gulf, high heavy clouds, rain-heads. The men in the fields looked up at the clouds and sniffed at them and held wet fingers up to sense the wind. And the horses were nervous while the clouds were up. The rain-heads dropped a little spattering and hurried on to some other country. Behind them the sky was pale again and the sun flared. In the dust there were drop craters where the rain had fallen, and there were clean splashes on the corn, and that was all. 
SteinJGW.txt	6	4.0	1939	Steinbeck, John	The grapes of wrath	          Chapter 2    A HUGE RED TRANSPORT TRUCK stood in front of the little roadside restaurant. The vertical exhaust pipe muttered softly, and an almost invisible haze of steel-blue smoke hovered over its end. It was a new truck, shining red, and in twelve-inch letters on its sides— OKLAHOMA CITY TRANSPORT COMPANY. Its double tires were new, and a brass padlock stood straight out from the hasp on the big back doors. Inside the screened restaurant a radio played, quiet dance music turned low the way it is when no one is listening. A small outlet fan turned silently in its circular hole over the entrance, and flies buzzed excitedly about the doors and windows, butting the screens. Inside, one man, the truck driver, sat on a stool and rested his elbows on the counter and looked over his coffee at the lean and lonely waitress. He talked the smart listless language of the roadsides to her. “I seen him about three months ago. He had a operation. Cut somepin out. I forget what.’’ And she—“Doesn’t seem no longer ago than a week I seen him myself. Looked fine then. He’s a nice sort of a guy when he ain’t stinko.“1 Now and then the flies roared softly at the screen door. The coffee machine spurted steam, and the waitress, without looking, reached behind her and shut it off.

His eyes began at the new cap, moved down the new clothes to the new shoes. The hitch-hiker squirmed his back against the seat in comfort, took off his cap, and swabbed his sweating forehead and chin with it. “Thanks, buddy,’’ he said. “My dogs was pooped out.’’    “New shoes,’’ said the driver. His voice had the same quality of secrecy and insinuation his eyes had. “You oughtn’ to take no walk in new shoes—hot weather.’’    The hiker looked down at the dusty yellow shoes. “Didn’t have no other shoes,’’ he said. “Guy got to wear ’em if he got no others.’’    The driver squinted judiciously ahead and built up the speed of the truck a little. “Goin’ far?’’    “Uh-uh! I’d a walked her if my dogs wasn’t pooped out.’’    The questions of the driver had the tone of a subtle examination. He seemed to spread nets, to set traps with his questions. “Lookin’ for a job?’’ he asked.    “No, my old man got a place, forty acres. He’s a cropper, but we been there a long time.’’    The driver looked significantly at the fields along the road where the corn was fallen sideways and the dust was piled on it. Little flints shoved through the dusty soil. The driver said, as though to himself, “A forty-acre cropper and he ain’t been dusted out and he ain’t been tractored out?’’    “ ’Course I ain’t heard lately,’’ said the hitch-hiker.

Carloads of oranges dumped on the ground. The people came for miles to take the fruit, but this could not be. How would they buy oranges at twenty cents a dozen if they could drive out and pick them up? And men with hoses squirt kerosene on the oranges, and they are angry at the crime, angry at the people who have come to take the fruit. A million people hungry, needing the fruit—and kerosene sprayed over the golden mountains.    And the smell of rot fills the country.    Burn coffee for fuel in the ships. Burn corn to keep warm, it makes a hot fire. Dump potatoes in the rivers and place guards along the banks to keep the hungry people from fishing them out. Slaughter the pigs1 and bury them, and let the putrescence drip down into the earth.    There is a crime here that goes beyond denunciation. There is a sorrow here that weeping cannot symbolize. There is a failure here that topples all our success. The fertile earth, the straight tree rows, the sturdy trunks, and the ripe fruit. And children dying of pellagra must die because a profit cannot be taken from an orange. And coroners must fill in the certificates—died of malnutrition—because the food must rot, must be forced to rot.

In the foremention'd Reign there was a Gentleman whose name was Weston, a worthy Person of a large Estate near the City of Canterbury, who had been Father of many Children, but it pleased Heaven to    deprive him of all, except one Daughter his last born, on whom he bestow'd all that a fond Fater could, to make her a perfectly Accomplish'd young Lady: As she was heiress to a very considerable Estate, Mr. Weston was resolv'd to Qualify her in such a manner, as to double the value of her Fortune, by instilling into her Mind, such Principles as would not only secure her own Happiness, but that of the Person who should be destin'd her Partner for Life.  Her beauty, Merit and Fortune, from fifteen Years of Age, assembled a numerous train of Admirers, but as her heart was not affected by any of them 'till she was above seventeen, her Father would not insist on a Union with any, 'till she had met with the Man she thought she could be truly happy with; rather preferring his Daughter's Peace of Mind than her interest, as he could make a worthy Husband entirely easy in point of Circumstances, whom gratitude as well as Love, wou'd he conceiv'd, compel him to use his Child well not only by the Possession of a blooming Amiable Creature, but receiving an Advantage of Fortune, the want of which, has too often made way for a Fool, while a Man of Sense, has been deprived of    an Opportunity of tenderly making amends for Deficiency.

In a short time after, Mr. Dennis Set up his Son in a Silk Mercer's Shop, giving him a Fortune of four thousand Pounds, in ready Cash, besides Two thousand more in Stock.  Tho' this was a genteel Fortune, 'twas unequal to the young Lady's; whose Father gave her on the Day of Marriage, ten Thousand Pounds in Bank Notes, and at his Death left her ten Thousand more.  In a few Weeks after the young couple were married, they open'd a very Grand Shop in the City, and Mr. Dennis placed with his Son as his Foreman one Mr. Arnold an elderly discreet Man, who had serv'd in that    Capacity with young Dennis 's master, who having acquired a Competent Fortune, left off Trade and retir'd into the Country.  Mr. Arnold was a worthy Man, who having a very large Family, and meeting with misfortunes in Trade, was in his early Days so so unhappily reduc'd, as to be oblig'd to throw up his Business, that without Scandal or reproach he might do Justice to his Creditors, tho' he himself suffered greatly, from many to whom he had largely intrusted his Goods, for very considerable sums.  But as he was a Man of almost unprecedented Principles of honour, he rather chose to lead a life of servitude, than meanly buffet with ill fortune, to support at best a broken Reputation.

Young Dennis receiv'd his instructions in Trade from Mr. Arnold, who tutor'd him in so gentle a Manner, it occasion'd a great Regard and Tenderness on both sides, and gave the good Man such a power over Dennis that he strictly adher'd to what he advised or proposed, and thought himself under a certain    obligation to pay him the Respect due to Father, and was as fearful of Offending the Friendship of the one as of disobeying the Commands of the other.  But Alass Time which brings forth all strange and unaccountable things, wrought a fatal change in the disposition of this thoughtless young man, who instead of following the worthy examples of his industrious friend, soon after his kind father had settled him in such a manner, as enabled him in a few years to acquire an immense fortune; he grew tired of business, and too fond of every pleasurable expence that could possibly Conspire to effect his ruin, and destroy his fame; the first step towards his destruction was to set up an equipage, and furnish both his town and country house suitable to the dignity of a man of quality; as the family increased as it did every year by the birth of a child, additional servants were provided, and every needful expence was swell'd into a superfluity.  Among the rest of the follies he run into the encouragement of a set of hangers on, who made him their daily bread, was not the least.

And the only virtue that remained untainted in him, was a tender fondness for his wife and children, which indeed each had an undoubted claim to; the former for her uncommon merit in regard to her husband, and the World in general, the other from their inoffended innocence.  Mr. Arnold perceiving his master's growing ruin, took upon him to use the Priveledge of friendship, to warn of the dreadful consequences of persisting in a continuation of this course of life, but he had the mortification to find him cold and unwilling to hear or regard the tender admonitions he frequently made use of.  At last Mr. Dennis who was ready dress'd for a journey to his country house one morning, rang the bell, at which summons a youth who was a turn-over Apprentice to him instantly appeared and receiv'd an order from his master for Mr. Arnold to send him up a bill or cash, for fifty pounds, instead of the money Mr. Arnold sent his respects, and that he would wait upon him himself in a few momets, which accordingly he did, carrying    with him his book of accompts, instead of answering the demand made by the apprentice. When Mr. Arnold enter'd the room, Mr. Dennis perceiv'd the marks of real sorrow in his countenance, which shock'd him, but he still endeavour'd to hide it from the other, and demanded the money, upon which Mr. Arnold look'd at him very stedfastly, fetch'd a deep figh, desir'd him to look over those accompts and judge how much reason he had to suppose, that 'twas possible for him to expect such a draught to be answer'd, and after shewing him the accounts which he knew he would himself inspect, he sat down by him, and with an almost broken heart, insisting on his knowing the shameful misery he had reduced himself too, and thus address'd him.

Mr. Dennis was too sensible of the means he had used to prove the truth of his friend's assertion, and conservently remained silent for some time, at last conscious of his error, he    broke through his confusion, intreating Mr. Arnold to conceal the dreadful situation of his affairs from Mrs Dennis, who was entirely innocent and ignorant of them: The fortune (said he) which she brought me obliged me in honour to regard it as a more than sufficient competence to support her without exposing her to the care and fatigue of my business and tho' I have thro' a mistaken pride, and ridiculous ambition, to set myself above myself, undone my family, she poor soul, never was the least incentive to the ruin in which I have inconsiderately involv'd myself: What shall I do? the coach now waits at the door to carry her with my Sster to Woodford where we propose to remain 'till after Christmas, but the concern I justly labour under renders me incapable of pursuing my intent, or making any reasonable excuse to her for not going with her.

Miss Harriet took this as the highest proof of his Regard to her, tho' she was sorty he should hazard any part of his Fortune to serve her Relation, and that she wanted no such severe proofs of his Passion for her, for such she term'd it, as it was doubtful whether it would ever be in her Brother's power to make him a suitable return; but these fears did not prevent his generous design, which he put into immediate Execution the moment he got    to Town, and with Mr. Arnold 's assistance, every Creditor was paid to the full extent, the amount of which came to upwards of Fourteen Thousand Pounds.

No, it’s important to be more … On the stroke of midnight, as a matter of fact. Clock-hands joined palms in respectful greeting as I came. Oh, spell it out, spell it out: at the precise instant of India’s arrival at independence, I tumbled forth into the world. There were gasps. And, outside the window, fireworks and crowds. A few seconds later, my father broke his big toe; but his accident was a mere trifle when set beside what had befallen me in that benighted moment, because thanks to the occult tyrannies of those blandly saluting clocks I had been mysteriously handcuffed to history, my destinies indissolubly chained to those of my country. For the next three decades, there was to be no escape. Soothsayers had prophesied me, newspapers celebrated my arrival, politicos ratified my authenticity. I was left entirely without a say in the matter. I, Saleem Sinai, later variously called Snotnose, Stainface, Baldy, Sniffer, Buddha and even Piece-of-the-Moon, had become heavily embroiled in Fate—at the best of times a dangerous sort of involvement.

Yes, ask him that, ask that nakkoo Aziz!”    She had left a note. It read: “I didn’t mean it.”    I make no comment; these events, which have tumbled from my lips any old how, garbled by haste and emotion, are for others to judge. Let me be direct now, and say that during the long, hard winter of 1918-19, Tai fell ill, contracting a violent skin disease, akin to that European curse called the King’s Evil; but he refused to see Doctor Aziz, and was treated by a local homeopath.

On June 4th, my ill-matched parents left for Bombay by Frontier Mail. (There were hangings, voices hanging on for dear life, fists crying out, “Maharaj! Open for one tick only! Ohé, from the milk of your kindness, great sir, do us favor!” And there was also—hidden beneath dowry in a green tin trunk—a forbidden, lapis-lazuli-encrusted, delicately-wrought silver spittoon.) On the same day, Earl Mountbatten of Burma held a press conference at which he announced the Partition of India, and hung his countdown calendar on the wall: seventy days to go to the transfer of power … sixty-nine … sixty-eight … tick, tock.

Revealed: the deception which had tricked an accordionist’s wife. Samson-like, William Methwold’s power had resided in his hair; but now, bald patch glowing in the dusk, he flings his thatch through the window of his motor-car; distributes, with what looks like carelessness, the signed title-deeds to his palaces; and drives away. Nobody at Methwold’s Estate ever saw him again; but I, who never saw him once, find him impossible to forget.    Suddenly everything is saffron and green. Amina Sinai in a room with saffron walls and green woodwork. In a neighboring room, Wee Willie Winkie’s Vanita, green-skinned, the whites of her eyes shot with saffron, the baby finally beginning its descent through inner passages that are also, no doubt, similarly colorful. Saffron minutes and green seconds tick away on the clocks on the walls. Outside Doctor Narlikar’s Nursing Home, there are fireworks and crowds, also conforming to the colors of the night—saffron rockets, green sparkling rain; the men in shirts of zafaran hue, the women in saris of lime.
RushSM.txt	382	120960.0	1981	Rushdie, Salman	Midnight's Children	Ever since I lay hidden in a washing-chest and heard two scandalous syllables, I had been suspecting my mother of secrets; my incursions into her thought processes had confirmed my suspicions; so it was with a hard glint in my eye, and a steely determination, that I visited Sonny Ibrahim one afternoon after school, with the intention of enlisting his help.    I found Sonny in his room, surrounded by posters of Spanish bullfights, morosely playing Indoor Cricket by himself. When he saw me he cried unhappily, “Hey man I’m damn sorry about Evie man she won’t listen to anyone man what the hell’d you do to her anyway?” … But I held up a dignified hand, commanding and being accorded silence.    “No time for that now, man,” I said. “The thing is, I need to know how to open locks without keys.”    A true fact about Sonny Ibrahim: despite all his bullfighting dreams, his genius lay in the realm of mechanical things. For some time now, he had taken on the job of maintaining all the bikes on Methwold’s Estate in return for gifts of comic-books and a free supply of fizzy drinks. Even Evelyn Lilith Burns gave her beloved Indiabike into his care. All machines, it seemed, were won over by the innocent delight with which he caressed their moving parts; no contraption could resist his ministrations. To put it another way: Sonny Ibrahim had become (out of a spirit of pure inquiry) an expert at picking locks. 
RushSM.txt	390	120.0	1981	Rushdie, Salman	Midnight's Children	  But now hands enter the frame—first the hands of Nadir-Qasim, their poetic softness somewhat callused these days; hands flickering like candle-flames, creeping forward across reccine, then jerking back; next a woman’s hands, black as jet, inching forwards like elegant spiders; hands lifting up, off reccine tabletop, hands hovering above three fives, beginning the strangest of dances, rising, falling, circling one another, weaving in and out between each other, hands longing for touch, hands outstretching tensing quivering demanding to be—but always at last jerking back, fingertips avoiding fingertips, because what I’m watching here on my dirty glass cinema-screen is, after all, an Indian movie, in which physical contact is forbidden lest it corrupt the watching flower of Indian youth; and there are feet beneath the table and faces above it, feet advancing towards feet, faces tumbling softly towards faces, but jerking away all of a sudden in a cruel censor’s cut … two strangers, each bearing a screen-name which is not the name of their birth, act out their half-unwanted roles. I left the movie before the end, to slip back into the boot of the unpolished unwatched Rover, wishing I hadn’t gone to see it, unable to resist wanting to watch it all over again.    What I saw at the very end: my mother’s hands raising a half-empty glass of Lovely Lassi; my mother’s lips pressing gently, nostalgically against the mottled glass; my mother’s hands handing the glass to her Nadir-Qasim; who also applied, to the opposite side of the glass, his own, poetic mouth. So it was that life imitated bad art, and my uncle Hanif’s sister brought the eroticism of the indirect kiss into the green neon dinginess of the Pioneer Café.

And one day, amongst the card-players, I recognized the sunken-eyed, ascetic form of Mr. Homi Catrack. Who greeted me with embarrassed heartiness: “Hi there, young chap! Doing fine? Of course, of course you are!”    My uncle Hanif played rummy dedicatedly; but he was in the thrall of a curious obsession—namely, that he was determined never to lay down a hand until he completed a thirteen-card sequence in hearts. Always hearts; all the hearts, and nothing but the hearts would do. In his quest for this unattainable perfection, my uncle would discard perfectly good threes-of-a-kind, and whole sequences of spades clubs diamonds, to the raucous amusement of his friends. I heard the renowned shehnai-player Ustad Changez Khan (who dyed his hair, so that on hot evenings the tops of his ears were discolored by running black fluid) tell my uncle; “Come on, mister; leave this heart business, and just play like the rest of us fellows.” My uncle confronted temptation; then boomed above the din, “No, dammit, go to the devil and leave me to my game!” He played cards like a fool; but I, who had never seen such singleness of purpose, felt like clapping. 
RushSM.txt	560	80640.0	1981	Rushdie, Salman	Midnight's Children	  There was a new brilliance about my parents in those days; Amina had lost her guilt-fog, her verrucas seemed not to be playing up any more; while Ahmed, although still whitened, had felt the freeze of his loins thawing under the heat of his newfound love for his wife. On some mornings, Amina had toothmarks on her neck; she giggled uncontrollably at times, like a schoolgirl. “You two, honestly,” her sister Alia said, “Like honeymooners or I don’t know what.” But I could smell what was hidden behind Alia’s teeth; what stayed inside when the friendly words came out … Ahmed Sinai named his towels after his wife: Amina Brand.    “Who are these multi-multis? These Dawoods, Saigols, Haroons?” he cried gaily, dismissing the richest families in the land. “Who are Valikas or Zulfikars? I could eat them ten at a time. You wait!”, he promised, “In two years the whole world will be wiping itself on an Amina Brand cloth. The finest terry-cloth! The most modern machines! We shall make the whole world clean and dry; Dawoods and Zulfikars will beg to know my secret; and I will say, yes, the towels are high-quality; but the secret is not in the manufacturing; it was love that conquered all.” (I discerned, in my father’s speech, the lingering effects of the optimism virus.)    Did Amina Brand conquer the world in the name of cleanliness (which is next to …)? Did Valikas and Saigols come to ask Ahmed Sinai, “God, we’re stumped, yaar, how’d you do it?” Did high-quality terry-cloth, in patterns devised by Ahmed himself—a little gaudy, but never mind, they were born of love—wipe away the moistness of Pakistanis and export-markets alike? Did Russians Englishmen Americans wrap themselves in my mother’s immortalized name? … The story of Amina Brand must wait awhile; because the career of Jamila Singer is about to take off; the mosque-shadowed house on Clayton Road has been visited by Uncle Puffs.

Morarji Desai, the Finance Minister, and Jagjivan Ram, most powerful of the untouchables, united in their determination to prevent the establishment of a Nehru dynasty; so Indira Gandhi was denied the leadership. The new Prime Minister was Lal Bahadur Shastri, another member of that generation of politicians who seemed to have been pickled in immortality; in the case of Shastri, however, this was only maya, illusion. Nehru and Shastri have both fully proved their mortality; but there are still plenty of the others left, clutching Time in their mummified fingers and refusing to let it move … in Pakistan, however, the clocks ticked and tocked.    Reverend Mother did not overtly approve of my sister’s career; it smacked too much of film-stardom. “My family, whatsitsname,” she sighed to Pia mumani, “is even less controllable than the price of gas.” Secretly, however, she may have been impressed, because she respected power and position and Jamila was now so exalted as to be welcome in the most powerful and best-placed houses in the land … my grandmother settled in Rawalpindi; however, with a strange show of independence, she chose not to live in the house of General Zulfikar. She and my aunt Pia moved into a modest bungalow in the old part of town; and by pooling their savings, purchased a concession on the long-dreamed-of petrol pump.

O anticipatory salivation before screens trumpeting COMING SOON!—Because the promise of exotic futures has always seemed, to my mind, the perfect antidote to the disappointments of the present.) “Stop, stop,” I exhort my mournfully squatting audience, “I’m not finished yet! There is to be electrocution and a rain-forest; a pyramid of heads on a field impregnated by leaky marrowbones; narrow escapes are coming, and a minaret that screamed! Padma, there is still plenty worth telling: my further trials, in the basket of invisibility and in the shadow of another mosque; wait for the premonitions of Resham Bibi and the pout of Parvati-the-witch! Fatherhood and treason also, and of course that unavoidable Widow, who added to my history of drainage-above the final ignominy of voiding-below … in short, there are still next-attractions and coming-soons galore; a chapter ends when one’s parents die, but a new kind of chapter also begins.”    Somewhat consoled by my offers of novelty, my Padma sniffs; wipes away mollusc-slime, dries eyes; breathes in deeply … and, for the spitton-brained fellow we last met in his hospital bed, approximately five years pass before my dung-lotus exhales.

The Sundarbans: it swallows them up.            In the Sundarbans      I’LL OWN UP: there was no last, elusive quarry, driving us south south south. To all my readers, I should like to make this naked-breasted admission: while Ayooba Shaheed Farooq were unable to distinguish between chasing-after and running-from, the buddha knew what he was doing. Although I’m well aware that I am providing any future commentators or venom-quilled critics (to whom I say: twice before, I’ve been subjected to snake-poison; on both occasions, I proved stronger than venenes) with yet more ammunition—through admission-of-guilt, revelation-of-moral-turpitude, proof-of-cowardice—I’m bound to say that he, the buddha, finally incapable of continuing in the submissive performance of his duty, took to his heels and fled. Infected by the soul-chewing maggots of pessimism futility shame, he deserted, into the historyless anonymity of rain-forests, dragging three children in his wake. What I hope to immortalize in pickles as well as words: that condition of the spirit in which the consequences of acceptance could not be denied, in which an overdose of reality gave birth to a miasmic longing for flight into the safety of dreams … But the jungle, like all refuges, was entirely other—was both less and more—than he had expected.

Saleem, today, is certain that he answered, “Yes”; that on the selfsame morning, still dressed in shapeless robe, still inseparable from a silver spittoon, he walked away, without looking back at a girl who followed him with eyes moistened with accusations; that, strolling hastily past practising jugglers and sweetmeat-stalls which filled his nostrils with the temptations of rasgullas, past barbers offering shaves for ten paisa, past the derelict maunderings of crones and the American-accented caterwauls of shoe-shine boys who importuned bus-loads of Japanese tourists in identical blue suits and incongruous saffron turbans which had been tied around their heads by obsequiously mischievous guides, past the towering flight of stairs to the Friday Mosque, past vendors of notions and itr-essences and plaster-of-Paris replicas of the Qutb Minar and painted toy horses and fluttering unslaughtered chickens, past invitations to cockfights and empty-eyed games of cards, he emerged from the ghetto of the illusionists and found himself on Faiz Bazar, facing the infinitely-extending walls of a Red Fort from whose ramparts a prime minister had once announced independence, and in whose shadow a woman had been met by a peepshow-merchant, a Dilli-dekho man who had taken her into narrowing lanes to hear her son’s future foretold amongst mongeese and vultures and broken men with leaves bandaged around their arms; that, to be brief, he turned to his right and walked away from the Old City towards the roseate palaces built by pink-skinned conquerors long ago: abandoning my saviors, I went into New Delhi on foot.

In one world, captains, there is no room for two Most Charming Men.”    The vendor of betel-nut delicacies, shrugging delicately, expectorated at our feet.    Like a magic spell, the taunts of a paan-wallah opened the door through which Saleem returned to the city of his birth, the abode of his deepest nostalgia.

In giving to the world the record of what, considered as an   adventure only, is I suppose one of the most wonderful and   mysterious experiences ever undergone by mortal men, I feel   it incumbent on me to explain my exact connexion with it.   So I will say at once that I am not the narrator but only the   editor of this extraordinary history, and then go on to tell   how it found its way into my hands.   Some years ago I, the editor, was stopping with a friend,   'vir doctissimus et amicus mens, ' at a certain University,   which for the purposes of this history we will call Cambridge,   and one day was impressed with the appearance of two   persons whom I saw walking arm in arm down the street.   One of these gentlemen was, I think without exception, the   handsomest young fellow I have ever seen. He was very   tall, very broad, and had a look of power and a grace of bearing   that seemed as native to him as to a wild stag. In addition   his face was almost without flaw — a good face as well as   a beautiful one, and when he lifted his hat, which he did just   then to a passing lady, I saw that his head was covered with   little golden curls growing close to the scalp.

What a splendid fellow he is ! '   ' Yes, ' he answered, ' he is the handsomest man in the   University, and one of the nicest too. They call him " the   Greek god." But look at the other one; he is Vincey's (that's   the god's name) guardian, and supposed to be full of every   B   <pb>  2   Site   kind of information. They call him " Charon, " either   because of his forbidding appearance or because he has ferried   his ward across the deep waters of examination — I don't know   which.'   I looked, and found the older man quite as interesting in   his way as the glorified specimen of humanity at his side.   He appeared to be about forty years of age, and I think was   as ugly as his companion was handsome. To begin with, he   was short, rather bow legged, very deep chested, and with   unusually long arms. He had dark hair and small eyes, and   the hair grew down on his forehead, and his whiskers grew   quite up to his hair, so that there was uncommonly little of   his countenance to be seen. Altogether he reminded me   forcibly of a gorilla, and yet there was something very   pleasing and genial about the man's eye. I remember saying   that I should like to know him.

He placed the box upon the table, and then fell   into an awful fit of coughing. He coughed and coughed till   his face became quite purple, and at last he sank into a chair   and began to spit up blood. I poured out some whisky into   a tumbler, and gave it to him. He drank it, and seemed   ■ better ; although his better was very bad indeed.

Nor did quarrels arise out of it, at least among   the men, who, when their wives deserted them in favour of a   rival, accepted the matter much as we accept the income   tax or our marriage laws, as something not to be disputed,   and as tending to the good of the community, however   disagreeable they may prove to the individual in particular   instances.   It is very curious to observe how the customs of mankind   on this question vary in different countries, making morality   an affair of latitude and religion, and what is right in one   place wrong and improper in another. It must, however, be   understood that, since all civilised nations appear to accept   it as an axiom that ceremony is the touchstone of morals,   there is, even according to our canons, nothing immoral about   this Amahagger custom, since the public interchange of an   embrace answers to our ceremony of marriage, which, as we   know, justifies most things.   <pb>  VII.

There we all sat in perfect silence, staring at the   glare and glow of the large fire, and at the shadows thrown   by the flickering earthenware lamps — which, by the way, were   not ancient. On the open space between us and the fire lay   a large wooden tray, with four short handles to it, exactly like   a butcher's tray, only not hollowed out. By the side of the   tray was a great pair of long handled iron pincers, and on the   other side of the fire was a similar pair. Somehow I did not   at all like the appearance of this tray and of the accompanying   pincers. There I sat contemplating them and the silent   circle of the fierce moody faces of the men, reflecting that it   was all very awful, and that we were absolutely in the power   of this fearsome people, who, to me at any rate, were all the   more formidable because their true^character was still very   much of a mystery to us. They might be better than I   thought them, or they might be worse. I feared that they   were worse, and I was not wrong. It was a curious sort of a   feast, I reflected, in appearance indeed an entertainment of the   Barmecide stamp, for there was absolutely nothing to eat.

' Is the meat ready to be cooked ?' asked the voice, more   rapidly.   ' It is ready ; it is ready.'   ' Is the pot hot to cook it ?' it continued, in a sort of   scream that echoed painfully down the great recesses of the   cave.   ' It is hot; 1t is hut.'   ' Great heavens!' shouted Leo, ' remember the writing,   " The people who place pots upon the heads of strangers." '   As he said the words, before we could stir, or even take   the matter in, two great ruffians sprang up, and, grasping the   long pincers, plunged them into the heart of the fire, while the   woman who had been caressing Mohammed suddenly produced   a fibre noose from under her girdle or moocha, and, slipping   it over his shoulders, ran it tight, the men next him seizing   him by the legs. These two men with the pincers heaved simultaneously,   and, scattering the fire this way and that upon the   rocky floor, lifted from it a large earthenware pot, heated to a   white glow. In an instant, almost with a single movement,   they had reached the spot where Mohammed was struggling.

Afterwards I discovered that it could not cover   less than fifty square miles of ground. Anything more grand   and imposing than the sight presented by this great natural   castle, starting in solitary grandeur from the level of the plain,   I never saw, and I suppose I never shall. Its very solitude   added to its majesty, and its towering cliffs seemed to kiss the   sky.

I looked, and saw what appeared to be the line of roadway   running straight towards the base of the mountain, though it   was covered with turf. There were high banks on each side   of it, broken here and there, but fairly continuous on the   whole, the meaning of which I did not understand.

The flame rose and fell, reflecting itself in   Ayesha's agonised eyes ; the hissing sound of her terrible   maledictions, and no words of mine can convey how terrible   they were, ran round the walls and died away in little echoes,   and the fierce light and deep gloom alternated themselves   on the white and dreadful form stretched upon that bier of   stone.   But at length she seemed to wear herself out and ceased.   She sat herself down upon the rocky floor, shaking the dense   cloud of beautiful hair over her face and breast, and began to   sob terribly in the torture of a heartrending despair.   ' Two thousand years, ' she moaned — ' two thousand years   have I waited and endured; but though century doth still   creep on to century, and time give place to time, the sting of   memory hath not lessened, the light of hope doth not shine   more bright.

Then she led the way to the centre of the cave,   stopping at a spot where a round rock had been let into a   kind of large manhole in the flooring, accurately filling it just   as the iron plates fill the holes in the London pavements down   which the coals are thrown. ' Thou seest, ' she said. ' Tell   me, what is it ? '   ' Nay, I know not, ' I answered; whereon she crossed to   the left hand side of the cave (looking towards the entrance)   and signed to the mutes to hold up the lamps. On the wall   was something painted with a red pigment in similar characters   to those hewn beneath the sculpture of Tisno, King of K6r.   This long inscription Ayesha translated to me, the pigment   still being quite fresh enough to show the form of the letters.   It ran as follows: —   ' I, Junis, a priest of the Great Temple of K6r, write this   upon the rock of the burying place in the year four thousand   eight hundred and three from the founding of K6r. K6r is   fallen ! No more shall the mighty feast in her halls, no   more shall she rule the world, and her navies go out to commerce   with the world. Kor is fallen! and her mighty works,   and all the cities of Kor, and all the harbours that she built   and the canals that she made, are for the wolf and the owl   "nd the wild swan, and the barbarian who comes after.

Anything more   appalling than this jumbled mass of the remains of a departed   race I cannot imagine, and what made it even more dreadful   was that in this dry air a considerable number of the bodies   had become desiccated with the skin still on them, and now,   1 The name of the tribe, ' ama hagger, ' would seem to indicate a curious   mingling of races such as might easily have occurred in the neighbourhood   of the Zambesi. The prefix ' Ama' is common to the Zulu and   kindred races, and signifies ' people, ' while ' hagger ' is an Arabic word   meaning a stone. — Editor.   <pb>  The Tombs of Kor   179   fixed in every conceivable position, stared at us out of the   mountain of white bones, grotesquely horrible caricatures   of humanity. In my astonishment I uttered an ejaculation,   and the echoes of my voice, ringing in that vaulted space,   disturbed a skull which had been accurately balanced for   many thousands of years near the apex of the pile. Down it   came with a run, bounding along merrily towards us, and of   course bringing an avalanche of other bones after it, till at   last the whole pit rattled with their movement, even as though   the skeletons were rising up to greet us.

As it chanced, however,   <pb>  Go, Woman!' 207   he was merely curious, and also, like myself, somewhat   awed, for, though no hint had been given to him by She   of her extraordinary age, not unnaturally he came to identify   her with the woman spoken of on the potsherd. At last, quite   driven into a corner by his continual questions, which he   showered on me while be was dressing on this third morning,   I referred him to Ayesha, saying, with perfect truth; that I   did not know where Ustane was. Accordingly, after Leo had   eaten a hearty breakfast, we adjourned into She's presence,   for her mutes had orders to admit us at all hours.

When ye   have done your eating — I would that I could teach thee to eat   nought but fruit, Kallikrates, but that will come after thou   hast washed in the fire; once I, too, ate flesh like a brute   beast — when ye have done, I say, we will go out, and I will   show you this great temple and the god whom men once   worshipped there.'   Of course we rose ai once, and started. And here again   my pen fails me. To give a string of measurements and   details of the various courts of the temple would only be   wearisome, supposing that I had them ; and yet I know not   how I am to describe what we saw, magnificent as it was   <pb>  The Temple of Truth 257   even in its ruin, almost beyond the power of realisation.   Court upon dim court, row upon row of mighty pillars — some   of them, especially at the gateways, sculptured from base   to capital — space upon space of empty chambers that spoke   more eloquently to the imagination than any crowded streets.

Then a great fury filled me, making me mad, and I   seized the javelin that thou didst bear, and stabbed thee,   so that, at my feet, in the very place of Life, thou didst   groan and go down into death. I knew not then that I had   strength to slay with mine eyes and by the power of my will,   therefore in my madness I slew with the javelin   ' And when thou wast dead, ah ! I wept, because I was   undying and thou wast dead. I wept there in the place of   Life so that had I been mortal any more my heart had surely   broken.

haggardshe.txt	459	30.0	1887	Haggard, H Rider	She	  This slope was very steep and often precipitous, but it was   nowhere impassable, and by the light of the lamps we climbed   down it with no great difficulty, though it was gloomy work   enough travelling on thus, none of us knew whither, into   the dead heart of a volcano. As we went, however, I   took the precaution of noting our route as well as I could;   and this was not so very difficult, owing to the extraordinary   and most fantastic shapes of the rocks that were strewn about,   many of which in that dim light looked more like the   grim faces carven upon mediaeval gargoyles than ordinary   boulders.   For a considerable time we travelled on thus, half an hour   I should say, till, after we had descended many hundreds of   <pb>  The Spirit of Life   279   feet, I perceived that we had reached the point of the inverted   cone, where, at the very apex of the funnel, we found a   passage, so low and narrow that we were forced to stoop as   we crept along it. After some fifty yards of this creeping the   passage suddenly widened into a cave, so huge that we could   see neither the roof nor the sides. Indeed, we only knew   that it was a cave by the echo of our tread and the perfect   quiet of the heavy air.
haggardshe.txt	509	1008000.0	1887	Haggard, H Rider	She	Suffice it to say that, after incredible hardships and privations, we did reach the Zambesi, which proved to be about a hundred and seventy miles south of the spot where Billali left us. There for six months we were imprisoned by a savage tribe, who believed us to be supernatural beings, chiefly on account of Leo's youthful face and snow-white hair. From these people we escaped, and, crossing the Zambesi, wandered southwards, where, when on the point of starvation, we were sufficiently fortunate to fall in with a half caste Portuguese hunter who had followed a troop of elephants farther inland than he had ever been before. This man treated us most hospitably, and, after innumerable sufferings and adventures, ultimately, through his assistance, we reached Delagoa Bay, more than eighteen months from the time when we emerged from the marshes of Kor, and on the next day were so fortunate as to catch one of the steamboats that trade round the Cape to England. Our journey home was prosperous, and we set foot on the quay at Southampton exactly two years from the date of our departure upon our wild and seemingly ridiculous quest. Now I write these last words with Leo leaning over my shoulder in the old room in my college,the same into which some two and twenty years ago my poor friend Vincey stumbled on the memorable night of his death, bearing with him the iron chest.
haggardshe.txt	510	2628000.0	1887	Haggard, H Rider	She	  Here ends this history so far as it concerns science   and the outside world. What its end will be as regards   Leo and myself is more than I can guess. But we feel that   is not reached yet. A story that began more than two   thousand years ago may stretch a long way into the dim and   distant future.   Is Leo really a reincarnation of that ancient Kallikrates   of whom the inscription tells ? Or was Ayesha deceived by   some strange hereditary resemblance ? And, another question   : In this play of reincarnations, had Ustane aught to   do with the Amenartas of long ago ? The reader must form   his own opinion on these as on many other matters. I have   mine, which is that, as regards Leo, She made no mistake.   Often I sit alone at night, staring with the eyes of my   mind into the blackness of unborn time, and wondering in   what shape and form the great drama will be finally developed,   and where the scene of its next act will be laid. And when,   ultimately, that final development occurs, as I have no doubt   it must and will occur, in obedience to a fate that never   swerves and a purpose which cannot be altered, what will be   the part played therein by that beautiful Egyptian Amenartas,   the Princess of the royal race of the Pharaohs, for the love   of whom the Priest Kallikrates broke his vows to Isis, and,   pursued by the inexorable vengeance of the outraged Goddess,   fled down the coast of Libya to meet his doom at Kor ?
FrosMT.txt	0	120.0	1993	Frost, Mark	The list of 7	    AN ENVELOPE          THE ENVELOPE WAS VELLUM, CREAM. FINE STRIATIONS, CRISP, no watermarks. Expensive. Scuffed at the corners, it had attracted grime as it was slid under the door, silently. The Doctor did not hear it, and his ears were keen, sharp as a crone’s knees, like all his senses.    He was in the front room, had been throughout the evening, feeding the fire, absorbed in an obscure text. Forty-five minutes earlier, he had glanced up as the Petrovitch woman ascended the stairs, the scrabbly scuttle of her dachshund’s claws dragging her back to an evening of heart-heavy sighs amid the torpid musk of stewed red cabbage. The Doctor watched their spidery shadows flit by, dancing off the glazed floorboards under the door. There had been no envelope.    He vaguely remembered wishing there were an easier way to examine his timepiece than extracting it from his waistcoat and cracking it open. That was why, when he spent an evening in, he set it open, on his reading table. Time, or rather the elimination of its senseless squandering, obsessed him. And he had looked at his watch when the rat dog and its scrawny, melancholic Russian mistress shuffled by: quarter past nine.    The text drew him back. Isis Unveiled. Surely this Blavatsky woman was mad: another Russian, like poor Petrovitch with her plum wine. When you uprooted these Czarists and tried to replant them in English soil, was lunacy some inevitable consequence? Coincidence, he reasoned; one heartsick spinster and a megalomaniacal, cigar-chomping Transcendentalist did not constitute a trend. 
FrosMT.txt	1	3.0	1993	Frost, Mark	The list of 7	  He turned to study the photograph of Helena Petrovna Blavatsky in the frontispiece: the preternatural stillness, that clear, penetrating gaze. Most faces instinctively shrank from the insectoid jumble of the camera. She reached out and swallowed it whole. What was he to make of this curious tome? Isis Unveiled. Eight volumes to date, more threatened, all in excess of five hundred pages—and this only one-quarter of the woman’s oeuvre—a work purporting to assimilate and eclipse, with a ringing absence of irony, every known spiritual, philosophic, and scientific system of thought: in other words, a revisionist theory of all creation.    Although, according to the biographical passage under her picture, HPB had spent the better part of her fifty-odd years trotting the globe communing with this or that occultist ashram, she coyly attributed the book’s genesis to divine inspiration, courtesy of a steady roster of Ascended Masters materializing before her like Hamlet’s Ghost, claiming that occasionally one of these Holy of Holies stepped inside her head and assumed the reins: automatic writing, she called it. True, the book possessed two distinctly different styles—he hesitated to term them “voices”—but as to content, the thing was a flea market of mumbo jumbo: lost continents, cosmic rays, root races, evil cabals of black magicians. To be fair, he had in fact employed similar notions in his own writing, but that was fiction, for God’s sake, and she was offering this as theology. 
FrosMT.txt	72	12.0	1993	Frost, Mark	The list of 7	      He stopped to catch his breath under the vaulted exterior arch of St. Mary’s Church. He waited ten minutes in the shadows for the dreadful flapping to emerge from the darkness, for some vile avenging shadow to blot out the stars and streak down at him out of the sky. As his breathing steadied, the sweat that had soaked his shirt cooled, leaving him cold and shivery. Lights burned invitingly in the nave. He moved inside.    What had he escaped from? In the warm, same light of the church, the question turned on him; had his imagination transformed perfectly ordinary circumstances—say, an overzealous night watchman whose corduroy pants produced an insistent hissing—into a wallow of self-generated terror? He had studied how the strain of combat could induce in soldiers all manner of hallucinatory mental phenomena. Was he not now laboring under an even more insidious strain, in that his antagonists were unknown to him and could be, as Sacker had suggested, any passing stranger in the street? Perhaps this was their preferred method of assault, driving their victims mad with a constant noncorporeal menace more sensed than seen. Show a man a target he can strike back against, and you lend him a footing. Attack him with inexplicable night sounds, will-o’-the wisps, macabre scarecrows by the sides of train tracks, incite the stuff of his own nightmares, and the suggestive vagueness of it alone could send him reeling into lunacy.

You know, like a…” He went blank. Frozen as if he’d spilled sand in his gears.    “A tune-up fight,” said Barry, after a respectful silence.    “Right,” said Bodger, thwacking himself in the face again and jolting his mental machinery free from its rut. “Like a tune-up fight. Some drongo. Want to see what Bodger’s made of ’fore they puts their precious title on the line. So the Bodger says to them, wot’s fair is fair. Never let it be said Champeen Nuggins is a piker: Old Bodger puts on a show, he does, when some right gents lays out a few sponduliacks to catch my action.”    “So you had this tune-up fight.” said Doyle.    Bodger nodded and squiffed out another squirt of hot juice. “First thing, they tells me the tune-up’s not to take place in your stadium, your gamin’ hall, or even in your ring, as such. What they do is, see, they takes me to this warehouse like, down by the ribber.”    “This was not a legally sanctioned bout,” said Doyle, feeling more and more like an interpreter for some idiot prince.    “Not the full quid, no,” said Bodger, seeming to comprehend. “But truff be known, we bare knucklers are not unfamiliar wit’ the procedure.”    “So I take it that once you reached the wharf, these gentlemen introduced you to your opponent,” said Doyle patiently.

That principle is undoubtedly a good deal less class-conscious than I just stated.”    “No offense taken,” said Larry. “’Fink I’ll have a peepers.” He lit his candle off the torch and wandered off around the next cluster of boxes.    “We can put a stop to their wanton thievery, that much is certain,” said Doyle.    “Sealing that tunnel will put an end to the robberies, though I fear the worst has already been done and the trail gone cold: Witness the ruined condition of that padlock on the iron doors.”    Doyle nodded, conceding the point.    “Whether or not we can successfully bring charges to bear against the firm of Rathborne and Sons for these crimes is a good deal less certain. It may not in fact be in our best interest.”    “How so, Jack?”    “Without a shred of physical evidence to support the accusation, an assault on the venerated, unsullied names of the Brotherhood through the plodding course of the courts will only vouchsafe their acquittal and drive them deeper to ground, while heaping untold ridicule upon ourselves. If we’re to pursue them to the heart of their purpose, it’s best we keep our efforts from public view until the moment we can strike decisively.”    A low whistle came from Larry on the other side of the bend.
FrosMT.txt	358	2.5	1993	Frost, Mark	The list of 7	  “Keep walking; don’t run,” said Sparks.    Doyle pulled up short and shook off Sparks’s grip; they looked hard at each other. Doyle’s ambivalence shot through his studied mask of passivity, and Sparks did not misinterpret it.    “There! Over there!”    The acrobats had spotted them and were pointing frantically through the crowd. The bobbies headed in their direction.    “Doyle, this is no time—”    “I don’t know.”    “I can’t allow you to stay here—”    “You’re telling me I have no choice?”    “It’s a longer conversation—”    “We need to have it.”    “Not now. For God’s sake, man.”    Doyle wavered but would not be moved. The bobbies closed in.    “The boy, what he called me: Do you know what an arhanta is?” asked Sparks.    Doyle shook his head.    “It means savior.”    The bobbies were only a few yards away.    “Here, then, stand clear, you two!” said one of them.    Doyle shoved a bed in their direction, breaking their stride, and then he broke for the door. Sparks flew after him, and they burst through the door into a hospital corridor. An alarm sounded, and the pursuit behind them intensified.    “Which way?” asked Sparks.    Doyle pointed to their left, and they ran, dodging a host of startled patients and doctors and medical paraphernalia. Using his intimate knowledge of the hospital, changing directions frequently—in and out of wards, up and down stairs—and finally through a ground-floor window, Doyle led them to the entrance where Larry waited. A half-dozen bobbies were just arriving via Black Maria; Sparks blew a silver whistle that he’d pulled from his pocket and authoritatively waved them toward the doors. 
FrosMT.txt	410	2.3	1993	Frost, Mark	The list of 7	I remembered Whitby because we’d played here once before, in the height of summer, and the sea and the sailing ships in the harbor had been so very beautiful, and I wanted to sit on a bench by the sea-wall and look out at the ships as I had that summer and not move and to think for the longest time, and maybe then I would begin to forget what had happened, maybe I could heal what had been done to my mind.…”    Tears were flowing down her cheeks, but she made no move to brush them away. Her voice remained even and strong. “The next day I took the train here. I had no other clothes to wear, but my cloak was full enough to cover the bloodstains on my dress. I spoke to no one. I completed the journey undisturbed, although I’m sure many remarks were made about the strange woman in the fancy evening dress, traveling without luggage or companion. I took a room here, like some haunted, heartbroken lover. I bought these poor clothes and sent my dress out to be cleaned. The blood had spoiled the satin, but I couldn’t bear to part with it; it was my best dress, the only time I’d worn it before was New Year’s Eve a year ago—I was so absurdly happy the night I wore that dress, I thought my life was just beginning and…” She paused again, before pulling back and saying, simply: “…and so I took a room here and slept and waited for the company to arrive.”    She looked back at Stoker, indicating the next chapter of the story was his arrival, which brought the tale to its current pass. Even Sparks’s rectitude seemed mollified by the plain harshness of her ordeal. Doyle offered her his handkerchief, which she accepted without a word. 
FrosMT.txt	419	2.0	1993	Frost, Mark	The list of 7	  “No. Are you?”    She laughed a little. It reminded him of tinkling crystal goblets at an impossibly glamorous dinner. “No, I’m not married.”    Doyle nodded intently, looked down at the shotgun in his hands, and with great concentration rubbed an imaginary smudge off the barrel.    “I’ve never given you proper thanks,” she said more soberly.    “None necessary,” he said with a casually dismissing wave.    “Still. I owe you my life. You and Mr. Sparks.”    “There’s no reason for you to feel indebted in even the slightest way, Miss Temple. Given the chance, I would gladly do the same again and more,” he said, feeling emboldened. This time he held her eyes until she looked away.    She needed somewhere to stub out her cigarette. There was no ashtray on the bedstand. Casting around, Doyle came up with the wrapper from the biscuits and held it for her on the table as she tapped out the smoke. Their fingers brushed together lightly with an electric tingle that he didn’t believe he was imagining.    “I want to help you,” she said in a low and husky voice. “In any way I can. You must convey that to Mr. Sparks. Because, you see, I feel a certain responsibility.”    “You acted out of need. Urgent financial need. You couldn’t know what would happen. You had no way of knowing.”    As she finished with the cigarette, she looked up, and their faces were only inches apart. 
FrosMT.txt	432	1.8	1993	Frost, Mark	The list of 7	  “Miss Temple—” protested Doyle.    “All right, ladies, that’ll be quite enough of this prattle,” she said in a strong, projected voice. “Vespers are done for the evening, now run along; back to whatever hell-place you came from with you.”    “Barry,” said Sparks, a command.    Barry immediately jumped down after her. Larry pulled his knives and moved to the right, while Sparks drew a bead with the shotgun.    “Be gone, stupid spirits, fly away, disperse, or you’ll make us very angry—”    The ghostly voices suddenly stilled. Eileen stopped ten feet away from the penitent wraiths.    “That’s better,” she said approvingly. “Now the rest of you girls just trot on off as well. Go on.”    The ghostly figures lowered their hands. Barry slowly moved after Eileen, only a few strides behind her now.    “Miss Temple,” said Sparks, loud and clear, “move away from the center of the room, please.”    “We run into ghosts in the theater all the time—” she said.    “Please do as I say, now.”    She turned back to Sparks to argue. “There’s nothing to worry about, they’re perfectly harmless—”    Moving as one, the ghostly figures threw back their hoods, revealing hideously deformed and hairless heads that looked half human and half predatory bird. They let loose a shrill, paralyzing shriek and rose up above Eileen to a height of ten feet or more, preparing to strike.

Doyle and Eileen gathered the snowshoes, and they scrambled after Sparks. He dropped the lid so it hung over the lip of the hill that sloped steeply away from the ruins and anchored it with his foot.    “You first, Doyle. Grab the handles and hold on,” said Sparks.    The main band of pursuers burst out of the abbey behind them toward their position, a black-cloaked figure in the lead. Doyle pocketed his gun and jumped aboard. Sparks grabbed Eileen around the waist, pushed her down on the middle of the lid, and followed her onto it, using his weight to tip them over the edge. They slid forward and rapidly accelerated down the incline as the pack reached the lip: Two hoods hurled themselves after the makeshift sled, one raked a hand across Sparks’s back, nearly dislodging him before they pulled away from the tumbling bodies. The sled gained speed as they plummeted down the embankment in the dark; every bump and hillock sent them flying into the air, only to be rocked heavily as they hit the snow again.    “Can you steer?” shouted Sparks.    “I don’t think so!” answered Doyle. It was all he could do to hang on. The sheer cliffs falling to the sea somewhere on the right and their unknown proximity to them hurtled into his mind.

Chandros laughed genuinely. “Yes. Heady. Very good. Heady: Do you like that, Marcus?”    Drummond snorted, Doyle assumed disapprovingly.    “Marcus has been in violent need of a good, solid belly laugh for the last thirty years,” said Chandros. “And he needs it still.”    Drummond snorted again, seeming to confirm the opinion.    “For an accredited cynic and somewhat notorious man of the world, my friend the General manages to retain a remarkable naïveté.” Chandros took Doyle’s arm in his before he could respond and directed him down the corridor. “However, Doctor, apropos our prior discussion, regardless of its particular unlikelihood, I strongly believe that as a race of people we are on the verge of such a vast sea change of scientific discovery that it will transform forever life as we have known it.”    Another snort from Drummond: There were apparently shadings and nuances to the man’s use of the exclamation that would require months to interpret.

Then it’s a fairly simple matter; shuffle King Bertie and any inconvenient heirs off their mortal coil and it’s Bonny Prince So-and-so in the coronation coach on his way to Windsor.”    “But it could take twenty years.”    “Raising the child from infancy takes that long regardless. Meanwhile, our friends in the Seven consolidate their positions as peddlers of influence to the royal family. Before the accession, the young King is made carefully aware of the lineage of his left-handed path to power—initiated into the fold—and so begins his thousand-year reign at the head of the most powerful nation on earth.”    Sparks sat back. Doyle was astonished at how the scenario could sound so practical and at the same time utterly insane.    “Why would they do it, Jack?”    “A king can wage war. They’re in the business of building weapons. There’s a pragmatic reason. Perhaps the only sort with which we should concern ourselves for the moment.”    Doyle nodded, the coolness of this rationality as refreshing as spring water. “And the land. The convicts. Vamberg’s drug.”    “Man as rough clay. Playing at god,” said Sparks with a shrug.    “There must be a more practical use.”    Sparks paused. “Building a private militia.”    “For their defense?”    “Or some more belligerent purpose.”    “But the treatment didn’t work. Not with any reliability,” said Doyle, thinking of the ruined men being force-marched to their deaths.

His eyes went hard, his voice hoarse with emotion, withdrawn.    “Of course, Jack,” said Doyle.    Sparks nodded, rose abruptly from the table, and moved out the door before Doyle could react. The weight of this new knowledge added to Doyle’s oppressive weariness. He staggered to the rear of the car and looked in through the drawn curtains at Eileen in the lower berth. She hadn’t moved from the position he had first seen her assume, her breathing slow and regular. As quietly as he could manage—holding at bay a befogged awareness that this decision carried more import than could possibly seem apparent—Doyle climbed to the upper berth. Sleep—a sonorous, black, unconscious deep—came and took him quickly.        Doyle opened his eyes. No sensation of movement; the train was not moving. Daylight filtered into the berth. He looked at his watch—quarter past two in the afternoon—and parted the curtains, squinting against the brightness: a train yard, the one they had used before in Battersea, south of the city. He swung his feet over the side and climbed down. The lower berth was empty, as was the rest of the car. He exited. 
FrosMT.txt	556	1440.0	1993	Frost, Mark	The list of 7	  After puzzling it through, and after many long discussions with his beloved Louise, Doyle realized at last that what disturbed him most deeply, what haunted his waking hours, was the thought that this vivid, valiant, and extraordinary man, who had selflessly given his life for Queen and country, could vanish from the earth without so much as a moment’s acknowledgment. This was a profound injustice. Although he had personally sworn his service and secrecy in this matter to the Queen—and she was to call on him again, repeatedly, in years to come—Doyle in the end devised a way to honor his sworn oath to her, while paying tribute to the memory of the late Jonathan Sparks.    That night, with his wife and child lying safely in their beds, he reached for the pen that the Queen had given him and sat down to write a story about their mysterious friend.            EPILOGUE          “THERE, THE RIVER GOES DEEP THERE, AT THE BASE OF THE rocks. Current below is deep. Fast. The bodies, they are not always found.”    Doyle stands on the boardwalk at the rim overlooking Reichenbach Falls, as his hired Swiss guide, a broad-faced genial young man, points down at the cataract below.    “People jump, from there, you see,” the guide explains. “Women most frequent. Broken hearts. So many, over the years.” The man shook his head in an earnest simulation of despond.    “I understand,” says Doyle.

Publishing success about to transform his life forever, Dr. Doyle, Louise, and three-year-old daughter Mary Louise are enjoying their first excursion abroad.    “Has anyone ever survived?” asks Doyle.    The guide’s brow knits tightly. “One woman. Yes. She comes out, seven kilometers south down the river. Does not remember her name.”    Doyle nods, letting his gaze drift across the turbid water.    Farther down the boardwalk, strolling with her mother, little Mary Louise is captivated by the sight of an infant in its passing perambulator.    “Mummy, look at the baby,” she says, leaning over the edge to peer down at the child.    The parents, an unremarkable lower-middle-class couple, are taking a first vacation since the birth of their son the year before. The father, Alois, is a customs official, the mother, Klara, a simple country girl from Bavaria.    “Look at the eyes, Mummy,” says Mary. “Doesn’t it have the most beautiful eyes?”    The baby’s eyes are indeed beautiful. Inviting. Transfixing.    “Yes, he does, dear. Die Augen ist…sehr schön,” says Louise to the young parents, in her schoolgirl German.    “Thank you,” says Klara politely.    “Wo kommen Sie heraus?” asks Louise.    “We come from Austria,” answers Alois, uncomfortable with any foreigner, let alone an English gentlewoman.    Doyle, with the guard at the rail forty feet away, fails to notice their conversation.

As Klara turns the pram around she leans down to straighten her son’s bedding. She smiles at him, and says softly:    “Komm mit, Adolf.”             
robinsoncrusoe.txt	0	13140000.0	1719	Defoe, Daniel, 1660-1731	The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe	  CHAPTER I—START IN LIFE      I was born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good family,  though not of that country, my father being a foreigner of Bremen, who  settled first at Hull. He got a good estate by merchandise, and leaving  off his trade, lived afterwards at York, from whence he had married my  mother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very good family in that  country, and from whom I was called Robinson Kreutznaer; but, by the  usual corruption of words in England, we are now called—nay we call  ourselves and write our name—Crusoe; and so my companions always called  me.    I had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-colonel to an  English regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous  Colonel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk against the  Spaniards. What became of my second brother I never knew, any more than  my father or mother knew what became of me.    Being the third son of the family and not bred to any trade, my head  began to be filled very early with rambling thoughts. My father, who was  very ancient, had given me a competent share of learning, as far as  house-education and a country free school generally go, and designed me  for the law; but I would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea; and  my inclination to this led me so strongly against the will, nay, the  commands of my father, and against all the entreaties and persuasions of  my mother and other friends, that there seemed to be something fatal in  that propensity of nature, tending directly to the life of misery which  was to befall me. 
robinsoncrusoe.txt	1	20.0	1719	Defoe, Daniel, 1660-1731	The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe	  My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent counsel  against what he foresaw was my design. He called me one morning into his  chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and expostulated very warmly  with me upon this subject. He asked me what reasons, more than a mere  wandering inclination, I had for leaving father’s house and my native  country, where I might be well introduced, and had a prospect of raising  my fortune by application and industry, with a life of ease and pleasure.  He told me it was men of desperate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring,  superior fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon adventures, to rise  by enterprise, and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature out  of the common road; that these things were all either too far above me or  too far below me; that mine was the middle state, or what might be called  the upper station of low life, which he had found, by long experience,  was the best state in the world, the most suited to human happiness, not  exposed to the miseries and hardships, the labour and sufferings of the  mechanic part of mankind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury,  ambition, and envy of the upper part of mankind. He told me I might  judge of the happiness of this state by this one thing—viz. that this was  the state of life which all other people envied; that kings have  frequently lamented the miserable consequence of being born to great  things, and wished they had been placed in the middle of the two  extremes, between the mean and the great; that the wise man gave his  testimony to this, as the standard of felicity, when he prayed to have  neither poverty nor riches. 
robinsoncrusoe.txt	69	240.0	1719	Defoe, Daniel, 1660-1731	The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe	  I cast my eye to the stranded vessel, when, the breach and froth of the  sea being so big, I could hardly see it, it lay so far of; and  considered, Lord! how was it possible I could get on shore?    After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of my condition, I  began to look round me, to see what kind of place I was in, and what was  next to be done; and I soon found my comforts abate, and that, in a word,  I had a dreadful deliverance; for I was wet, had no clothes to shift me,  nor anything either to eat or drink to comfort me; neither did I see any  prospect before me but that of perishing with hunger or being devoured by  wild beasts; and that which was particularly afflicting to me was, that I  had no weapon, either to hunt and kill any creature for my sustenance, or  to defend myself against any other creature that might desire to kill me  for theirs. In a word, I had nothing about me but a knife, a  tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a box. This was all my provisions;  and this threw me into such terrible agonies of mind, that for a while I  ran about like a madman. Night coming upon me, I began with a heavy  heart to consider what would be my lot if there were any ravenous beasts  in that country, as at night they always come abroad for their prey. 
robinsoncrusoe.txt	114	33120.0	1719	Defoe, Daniel, 1660-1731	The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe	This was not  so difficult to me as the making the shovel: and yet this and the shovel,  and the attempt which I made in vain to make a wheelbarrow, took me up no  less than four days—I mean always excepting my morning walk with my gun,  which I seldom failed, and very seldom failed also bringing home  something fit to eat.    _Nov._ 23.—My other work having now stood still, because of my making  these tools, when they were finished I went on, and working every day, as  my strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen days entirely in widening  and deepening my cave, that it might hold my goods commodiously.    _Note_.—During all this time I worked to make this room or cave spacious  enough to accommodate me as a warehouse or magazine, a kitchen, a  dining-room, and a cellar. As for my lodging, I kept to the tent; except  that sometimes, in the wet season of the year, it rained so hard that I  could not keep myself dry, which caused me afterwards to cover all my  place within my pale with long poles, in the form of rafters, leaning  against the rock, and load them with flags and large leaves of trees,  like a thatch. 
robinsoncrusoe.txt	122	161280.0	1719	Defoe, Daniel, 1660-1731	The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe	  I carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may be sure, in their  season, which was about the end of June; and, laying up every corn, I  resolved to sow them all again, hoping in time to have some quantity  sufficient to supply me with bread. But it was not till the fourth year  that I could allow myself the least grain of this corn to eat, and even  then but sparingly, as I shall say afterwards, in its order; for I lost  all that I sowed the first season by not observing the proper time; for I  sowed it just before the dry season, so that it never came up at all, at  least not as it would have done; of which in its place.    Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or thirty stalks of  rice, which I preserved with the same care and for the same use, or to  the same purpose—to make me bread, or rather food; for I found ways to  cook it without baking, though I did that also after some time.    But to return to my Journal.    I worked excessive hard these three or four months to get my wall done;  and the 14th of April I closed it up, contriving to go into it, not by a  door but over the wall, by a ladder, that there might be no sign on the  outside of my habitation.

I had  three large axes, and abundance of hatchets (for we carried the hatchets  for traffic with the Indians); but with much chopping and cutting knotty  hard wood, they were all full of notches, and dull; and though I had a  grindstone, I could not turn it and grind my tools too. This cost me as  much thought as a statesman would have bestowed upon a grand point of  politics, or a judge upon the life and death of a man. At length I  contrived a wheel with a string, to turn it with my foot, that I might  have both my hands at liberty. _Note_.—I had never seen any such thing  in England, or at least, not to take notice how it was done, though since  I have observed, it is very common there; besides that, my grindstone was  very large and heavy. This machine cost me a full week’s work to bring  it to perfection.    _April_ 28, 29.—These two whole days I took up in grinding my tools, my  machine for turning my grindstone performing very well.    _April_ 30.—Having perceived my bread had been low a great while, now I  took a survey of it, and reduced myself to one biscuit cake a day, which  made my heart very heavy. 
robinsoncrusoe.txt	147	5760.0	1719	Defoe, Daniel, 1660-1731	The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe	  The 30th was my well day, of course, and I went abroad with my gun, but  did not care to travel too far. I killed a sea-fowl or two, something  like a brandgoose, and brought them home, but was not very forward to eat  them; so I ate some more of the turtle’s eggs, which were very good.  This evening I renewed the medicine, which I had supposed did me good the  day before—the tobacco steeped in rum; only I did not take so much as  before, nor did I chew any of the leaf, or hold my head over the smoke;  however, I was not so well the next day, which was the first of July, as  I hoped I should have been; for I had a little spice of the cold fit, but  it was not much.    _July_ 2.—I renewed the medicine all the three ways; and dosed myself  with it as at first, and doubled the quantity which I drank.    _July_ 3.—I missed the fit for good and all, though I did not recover my  full strength for some weeks after. While I was thus gathering strength,  my thoughts ran exceedingly upon this Scripture, “I will deliver thee”;  and the impossibility of my deliverance lay much upon my mind, in bar of  my ever expecting it; but as I was discouraging myself with such  thoughts, it occurred to my mind that I pored so much upon my deliverance  from the main affliction, that I disregarded the deliverance I had  received, and I was as it were made to ask myself such questions as  these—viz.

In this frame of thankfulness I went home to my castle, and began to be  much easier now, as to the safety of my circumstances, than ever I was  before: for I observed that these wretches never came to this island in  search of what they could get; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not  expecting anything here; and having often, no doubt, been up the covered,  woody part of it without finding anything to their purpose.
robinsoncrusoe.txt	264	30240.0	1719	Defoe, Daniel, 1660-1731	The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe	  Sometimes I thought if digging a hole under the place where they made  their fire, and putting in five or six pounds of gunpowder, which, when  they kindled their fire, would consequently take fire, and blow up all  that was near it: but as, in the first place, I should be unwilling to  waste so much powder upon them, my store being now within the quantity of  one barrel, so neither could I be sure of its going off at any certain  time, when it might surprise them; and, at best, that it would do little  more than just blow the fire about their ears and fright them, but not  sufficient to make them forsake the place: so I laid it aside; and then  proposed that I would place myself in ambush in some convenient place,  with my three guns all double-loaded, and in the middle of their bloody  ceremony let fly at them, when I should be sure to kill or wound perhaps  two or three at every shot; and then falling in upon them with my three  pistols and my sword, I made no doubt but that, if there were twenty, I  should kill them all. This fancy pleased my thoughts for some weeks, and  I was so full of it that I often dreamed of it, and, sometimes, that I  was just going to let fly at them in my sleep.

He had no clothes on but a seaman’s waistcoat, a  pair of open-kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen shirt; but nothing to  direct me so much as to guess what nation he was of. He had nothing in  his pockets but two pieces of eight and a tobacco pipe—the last was to me  of ten times more value than the first.    It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in my boat to this  wreck, not doubting but I might find something on board that might be  useful to me. But that did not altogether press me so much as the  possibility that there might be yet some living creature on board, whose  life I might not only save, but might, by saving that life, comfort my  own to the last degree; and this thought clung so to my heart that I  could not be quiet night or day, but I must venture out in my boat on  board this wreck; and committing the rest to God’s providence, I thought  the impression was so strong upon my mind that it could not be  resisted—that it must come from some invisible direction, and that I  should be wanting to myself if I did not go. 
robinsoncrusoe.txt	332	1440.0	1719	Defoe, Daniel, 1660-1731	The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe	After I had begun to eat some I gave some to my man, who  seemed very glad of it, and liked it very well; but that which was  strangest to him was to see me eat salt with it. He made a sign to me  that the salt was not good to eat; and putting a little into his own  mouth, he seemed to nauseate it, and would spit and sputter at it,  washing his mouth with fresh water after it: on the other hand, I took  some meat into my mouth without salt, and I pretended to spit and sputter  for want of salt, as much as he had done at the salt; but it would not  do; he would never care for salt with meat or in his broth; at least, not  for a great while, and then but a very little.    Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was resolved to feast  him the next day by roasting a piece of the kid: this I did by hanging it  before the fire on a string, as I had seen many people do in England,  setting two poles up, one on each side of the fire, and one across the  top, and tying the string to the cross stick, letting the meat turn  continually. This Friday admired very much; but when he came to taste  the flesh, he took so many ways to tell me how well he liked it, that I  could not but understand him: and at last he told me, as well as he  could, he would never eat man’s flesh any more, which I was very glad to  hear. 
robinsoncrusoe.txt	362	20.0	1719	Defoe, Daniel, 1660-1731	The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe	  In this fit of fury I divided the arms which I had charged, as before,  between us; I gave Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, and three  guns upon his shoulder, and I took one pistol and the other three guns  myself; and in this posture we marched out. I took a small bottle of rum  in my pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with more powder and bullets;  and as to orders, I charged him to keep close behind me, and not to stir,  or shoot, or do anything till I bid him, and in the meantime not to speak  a word. In this posture I fetched a compass to my right hand of near a  mile, as well to get over the creek as to get into the wood, so that I  could come within shot of them before I should be discovered, which I had  seen by my glass it was easy to do.    While I was making this march, my former thoughts returning, I began to  abate my resolution: I do not mean that I entertained any fear of their  number, for as they were naked, unarmed wretches, it is certain I was  superior to them—nay, though I had been alone. But it occurred to my  thoughts, what call, what occasion, much less what necessity I was in to  go and dip my hands in blood, to attack people who had neither done or  intended me any wrong?

As soon as they got to the place where their other boat  lay, they ran their boat into the beach and came all on shore, hauling  the boat up after them, which I was glad to see, for I was afraid they  would rather have left the boat at an anchor some distance from the  shore, with some hands in her to guard her, and so we should not be able  to seize the boat. Being on shore, the first thing they did, they ran  all to their other boat; and it was easy to see they were under a great  surprise to find her stripped, as above, of all that was in her, and a  great hole in her bottom. After they had mused a while upon this, they  set up two or three great shouts, hallooing with all their might, to try  if they could make their companions hear; but all was to no purpose.

Upon  this, I told him that, if he desired it, I would undertake to bring the  two men he spoke of to make it their own request that he should leave  them upon the island. “I should be very glad of that,” says the captain,  “with all my heart.” “Well,” says I, “I will send for them up and talk  with them for you.” So I caused Friday and the two hostages, for they  were now discharged, their comrades having performed their promise; I  say, I caused them to go to the cave, and bring up the five men, pinioned  as they were, to the bower, and keep them there till I came. After some  time, I came thither dressed in my new habit; and now I was called  governor again.

In thisvoyage I visited my new colony in the island, saw my successors the Spaniards, had the old story of their lives and of the villains I left there; how at first they insulted the poor Spaniards, how theyafterwards agreed, disagreed, united, separated, and how at last theSpaniards were obliged to use violence with them; how they were subjected to the Spaniards, how honestly the Spaniards used them—a history, if it were entered into, as full of variety and wonderful accidents as my ownpart—particularly, also, as to their battles with the Caribbeans, who landed several times upon the island, and as to the improvement they made upon the island itself, and how five of them made an attempt upon themainland, and brought away eleven men and five women prisoners, by which, at my coming, I found about twenty young children on the island.

As to the Englishmen, I  promised to send them some women from England, with a good cargo of  necessaries, if they would apply themselves to planting—which I  afterwards could not perform. The fellows proved very honest and  diligent after they were mastered and had their properties set apart for  them. I sent them, also, from the Brazils, five cows, three of them  being big with calf, some sheep, and some hogs, which when I came again  were considerably increased.    But all these things, with an account how three hundred Caribbees came  and invaded them, and ruined their plantations, and how they fought with  that whole number twice, and were at first defeated, and one of them  killed; but at last, a storm destroying their enemies’ canoes, they  famished or destroyed almost all the rest, and renewed and recovered the  possession of their plantation, and still lived upon the island.    All these things, with some very surprising incidents in some new  adventures of my own, for ten years more, I shall give a farther account  of in the Second Part of my Story.

IN the rich and beautiful province of Andalusia lived the prince of Dorando, of the race of the ancient kings of Arragon. His family had long subsisted in splendour, and several branches of it were established in different parts of Europe. But Don Carlos, the last of the male line, having in his youth had some difference with his sovereign, quitted the court, and taking a disgust at the world, shut himself up in the castle of his ancestors.  Here he lived in retirement for upwards of thirty years; and although a prince of admirable parts, yet in    this gloom of solitude his mind lost its natural vigour; and, indifferent about his affairs, he resigned himself to the guidance of people who were artful enough to insinuate themselves into his favour.  Don Carlos had no brothers; but an only sister, amiable and accomplished, educated by the princess her mother in the strictest honour and piety. This lady refused many advantageous offers of marriage from sentiments of delicacy rarely to be found in one of her rank. She was often asked by her brother to marry; but she diverted the discourse by telling him, that it was his duty to continue his illustrious line. At last she listened to the addresses of Don Spiritoso, a cavalier of good family, somewhat advanced in life, but of very engaging manners. The princess Maria    herself, was then in her forty seventh year. 
BoswJDS.txt	1	525600.0	1767	Boswell, James, 1740-1795	DORANDO A SPANISH TALE.	Their nuptials were privately celebrated by the bishop of the city where they lived: for, understanding that the prince of Dorando had taken up some prejudice against Don Spiritoso, they resolved to conceal their marriage; and accordingly set out for France, taking with them Donna Justina, who had lived both with the princess and her mother in the character of a waiting-woman.  They resided for some time in a pleasant village in France, till the princess became pregnant, and her marriage could no longer be concealed; while at the same time she hoped, that the prince her brother could not be offended at an event, of which he should no sooner hear, than he should also be informed of its happy consequences.    The princess therefore wrote an affectionate letter to her brother, acquainting him of her situation, and begging his kind protection; but alas! the worthy prince had already been most unhappily imposed upon.  For in the neighbourhood of Dorando lived the prince of Arvidoso, who by an intermarriage of the families entertained some hopes of succession to the estate of Dorando. The adherents therefore of the family of Arvidoso did all in their power to poison the ear and vex the noble spirit of the unsuspecting Dorando. The principal of these adherents were Don Stocaccio, Don Tipponi, and Don Rodomontado. These three never ceased to throw the most injurious suspicions upon the character of the absent princess. They exaggerated every imprudency in the conduct of Don Spiritoso,    so as to prevent any hope of the prince being reconciled to his marriage with the lady Maria. At last the princess went to Paris, where she was safely delivered of two sons. 
BoswJDS.txt	3	525600.0	1767	Boswell, James, 1740-1795	DORANDO A SPANISH TALE.	The unfortunate Dorando believed the barbarous tale. He did not imagine that any man alive could have dared to tell the prince of Dorando, that his sister was an abandoned and infamous woman, had it not been true beyond a possibility of doubt. He felt the deepest anguish; but his spirit was roused with indignation; and he resolved never again to see his sister, and to show her every mark of his displeasure.  Having brought him to this state of mind, the adherents had no difficulty to accomplish their designs. The gentlest hints were sufficient; so that the prince of Dorando settled his    opulent domains on the house of Arvidoso, and sunk a family which had been illustrious for ages.  The princess Maria immediately returned to Spain with her husband and children. Her brother had withdrawn from her even the appointments which he had assigned for maintaining her court; and had it not been for the generosity of some of the neighbouring princes, the lady Maria Dorando must have been reduced to actual want.  All who lived under her brother lamented her situation. They crouded to see the children, and it was universally agreed, that Don Ferdinand, the eldest, had a strong resemblance to the prince his uncle; and that Don Philip, the youngest, was the very picture of his mother. The honest peasants kissed the hands of    the young princes with the sincerest marks of joy and affection, wishing that the prince could only see his nephews, as that would be sufficient to convince him how false were the suspicions against them.

Often did the lady Maria write to him in the most moving terms; but all in vain. She at last resolved to make a desperate effort, and went to the gate of his castle with her two children. And there did the princess Dorando and her sons stand like the lowest supplicants, till the prince should return an answer to a pathetic letter which she sent up to him. The prince began to relent. He walked through his castle musing with much agitation, while the big tear ran down his    cheek. But Stocaccio, like a hellhound, dogged him from room to room, and with a villainous appearance of concern, bid him be firm, nor weakly yield to the whining of a woman, who had forfeited every claim to his regard. The prince overcome with a tumult of contending passions, retired to his closet; and Stocaccio desired the servants to tell the lady Maria, that she could have no admittance there.  Treatment so harsh and severe from him who had formerly been a fond brother, was beyond measure distressing to the princess; but she behaved with calmness and moderation, for her hope was fixed on heaven.

She was in the deepest affliction, and the bitterness of her sorrow so affected her spirits that she never    recovered. When she felt the approach of death, she received the holy sacrament with much devotion. She called to her bed-side the prince Ferdinand her first born, and now only child, and, after leaving with him many pious lessons, she raised herself a little, as if animated with extraordinary life; 'My son, said she, be not cast down. God bless you. God make you a good and an honest man; for riches I despise. Take a sword in your hand, and you may one day be as great a hero as some of your predecessors.' Having thus spoke, she reclined her head with peace and complacency; while Don Ferdinand stood by her like 'the young eaglet of a valiant nest,' Douglas a Tragedy. in an attitude as if already facing all the dangers of the field, and at the same    time touched with the deepest concern for his dying mother, who expired a few minutes after.  Don Spiritoso, whose liberality of disposition far exceeded his fortune, was unable to support his son; but a princess of great worth, the friend of lady Maria, took under her protection the young Don Ferdinand, and gave him an education suitable to his real birth. And in whatever way it is, that the qualities of nobility are transmitted, it is certain, that this prince by his sentiments, his manners, and his air, could not but be acknowledged as of superiour rank. His uncle however remained inexorable, and Don Ferdinand never flattered himself with any expectation of happier days.

Donna Eleanora appeared at table with such gracefulness and majesty, that the prince often fixed his eyes upon her, and then hastily withdrawing them, was heard to say, 'This    is strange! This is strange!' After dinner she was shewn to her apartment to take a siesto, or gentle sleep, as is the custom in Spain. She dreamed that a lady appeared to her with a celestial countenance, informing her, she was the princess Maria, and saying, 'Noble lady, I am come to tell you, that Donna Eleanora was born for the deliverance of my injured son.'  This vision left a wonderful impression on the mind of Donna Eleanora; she wist not well what to think of it. She rose and went to the drawing room, where she found the prince reclined on a sofa, and playing on the lute with inimitable taste; she begged that he would continue his music, of which she was very fond. The prince did so, and touched the instrument with such delicacy, that    Donna Eleanora thought herself in an enchanted region. His airs were mostly melancholy; but he would now and then entertain the lady with a favourite love-song. After this they talked together till supper; and the prince seemed more and more delighted with her conversation. When she retired to her room at night, she could hardly sleep for reflecting on the extraordinary scene of the former day: but how much was she surprized next morning, when, on coming down to breakfast, she found the knight her father sitting with the prince of Dorando. 
BoswJDS.txt	10	10080.0	1767	Boswell, James, 1740-1795	DORANDO A SPANISH TALE.	His highness accosted her with true Spanish gallantry. 'Donna Eleanora, it would seem that heaven has destined you for my happiness. I sent an express at midnight for your father, whom I rejoice to see    under this roof. If your affections are not engaged, I hope you will accept the hand of the prince of Dorando.'  Donna Eleanora was struck with wonder. The vision came full in her mind; and she adored the benignity of Providence. Then turning to the prince; 'My affections, said she, are no otherways engaged than to this illustrious house. They have long been so engaged; and they are now a thousand times more so since I have seen the representative of the family. Your highness does me an honour which I cannot find words to express. It shall be the study of my life to deserve it.' His highnesses priest was called in to his presence, and the ceremony was immediately performed. Now madam, said the prince, I can show you my gallery    without being afraid of any reproof from you.  The news of this marriage flew over the country, and filled every honest heart with joy: but it was like a clap of thunder to the house of Arvidoso. They feared that their hopes were blasted. The adherents could not conceal their vexation, but went about cursing the day that Stocaccio died, and imprecating vengeance on Donna Eleanora. 
BoswJDS.txt	11	80640.0	1767	Boswell, James, 1740-1795	DORANDO A SPANISH TALE.	The prince Dorando now resumed in a great measure his former chearfulness. All the nobility around came and paid their court to him: and he found himself as fit for society as ever. He went to Sevile with his princess, and resided a part of the winter. His levee was continually crouded. A celebrated tragedy, in honour of his family, was performed in the    public theatre, where the prince himself appeared amidst the acclamations of the audience.  Something was still wanting to render the felicity compleat. The princess Dorando could have wished to have brought the prince a son of his own to take up his succession; but in the mean time she was anxious to undeceive him with regard to his nephew; and when she despaired of her own offspring, she became still more anxious. She took every opportunity of talking to the prince concerning his sister, and she convinced him of the falsity of many of the stories that had been told him.  It was now ten years since his nephew's birth, but Donna Justina was still alive in obscure apartments at Sevile. The prince was prevailed with to visit her, and was alone with    her for a considerable time, when he examined her as to the whole affair, with that keen penetration for which he was distinguished. The accounts which he heard from Donna Justina, were so direct, and enforced with such serious and solemn asseverations, while his strict attention made it impossible for her to dissemble, that the prince was much persuaded of his sister's innocence, and of the honour of his nephew. 
BoswJDS.txt	12	20160.0	1767	Boswell, James, 1740-1795	DORANDO A SPANISH TALE.	He owned this to the princess his consort, who insisted that he was called upon to show his conviction to the world, and to do justice to his injured heir. And when the prince seemed still to hesitate, her eagerness for the young Don Ferdinand would sometimes throw her into transports of passion, which her enemies represented as gross affectation, but which    the prince saw to be real. He therefore committed to the flames his settlements on the house of Arvidoso, and devised his succession to his nephew Don Ferdinand.  He was often asked by the princess to see his nephew, but he would not agree to it, crying, 'Ah madam! These wretches These wretches They have planted thorns in my mind, which have taken root for so many years, that I cannot entirely pull them out, without tearing myself to pieces. Let me alone! I cannot bear to think of the subject. It opens afresh the wounds of my heart I have been imposed upon I have been unjust I have been cruel But God knows, my intentions were upright I have made reparation, and my soul shall rest in peace.'    Soon after this, the prince Carlos Dorando died, and was carried in great funeral pomp to the tomb of his ancestors. 
BoswJDS.txt	13	20160.0	1767	Boswell, James, 1740-1795	DORANDO A SPANISH TALE.	The family of Arvidoso would not yet give over their designs upon the wealth of Dorando. Its prince was then in minority, and he had several guardians of high rank and character, but so extravagantly keen to aggrandize their pupil, that they grasped at a tempting appearance, without perceiving that it was only a bubble raised by the breath of malignity. They fondly wished to commence a process of Partus Suppositio, against Don Ferdinand; and to make enquiries for it, they sent privately to Paris Don Stivalbo, a lawyer, who lay under great obligations to the family of Arvidoso, and was prevailed    with to undertake the ungracious task.  Don Stivalbo was a man of principle, and he resolved to conduct himself with the utmost impartiality; but when he arrived at Paris, he was soon surrounded by French priests, advocates, and agents of all kinds, who wished no better than so fat a subject as the domains of Arvidoso and Dorando to feed upon. The gallant Stivalbo understanding little of their language, with true Spanish generosity, trusted to the reports of these gentry; who with many bows, shrugs, and compliments, pretended they had made astonishing discoveries, till Stivalbo had his imagination so warmed, that he himself gave credit to the imposture, and a suit was immediately raised before the senate of Sevile. 
BoswJDS.txt	14	1576800.0	1767	Boswell, James, 1740-1795	DORANDO A SPANISH TALE.	  In the meantime the guardians of Don Ferdinand began to be somewhat apprehensive, knowing that it was not difficult to bring very extraordinary proofs from the Gavaccios, as the Spaniards call the French, whom they detest. The princess dowager was determined to be at the bottom of the affair, and set out herself for Paris, carrying with her several lawyers of great eminence in their profession, and remarkable for their honour as private gentlemen. She had the satisfaction to find, upon a careful enquiry, that the house of Arvidoso had been led a wild-goosechace, and that there was nothing to fear.  The Arvidoso party, however, still continued their pursuit, changing their ground, and taking up a variety of different plans; so that the princess    was obliged to make no less than three or four journeys a-cross the Pyrenees, in order to get every new story refuted; and indeed this was easy enough, for no sooner did the priests of Arvidoso conjure up a spectre, than the princess Dorando found priests who as cleverly laid it. Such, however, was the ingenuity of the sharpset emissaries in France, that they contrived to keep the affair afloat for several years, while they were magnificently entertained by both parties, who, according to the Parisian phrase, avoient beaucoup d'esprit, et donnoient bien à manger. 
BoswJDS.txt	17	15.0	1767	Boswell, James, 1740-1795	DORANDO A SPANISH TALE.	We have the continued acknowledgment of parents. We have their positive and dying testimony; with the positive and dying testimony of a woman who was present at the birth of the    defendant. I lay my hand upon my heart, and I judge as I would wish to be judged. Can I then suppose all this to be a complication of guilt, of deliberate and downright perjury? No, signors; I cannot, unless upon a strong proof indeed. And what is the proof that has been brought? These testimonies remain untouched. They are uniform and consistent in the grand point. Upon what then do the plaintiffs rest their extraordinary plea? They have embarked us in a mare magnum of circumstances, picked up at the distance of fourteen years. And I must say, picked up from the streets of Paris, from the very dregs of the French Canaille. It is true, that the defendant has also his ragged evidences; but let us consider who first called in    the lame and the blind. Had not the plaintiffs built, the defendant had not been obliged to pull down. Signors, I am only surprised to see Don Pedro here. I know him, and I regard him; and it has all along been most difficult for me to reconcile the cause and the lawyer; but when I consider how imperceptibly he has been led away, I excuse him; and I here publickly acquit his honour. For my own part, signors, I have no difficulty; and were not the prince of Arvidoso a minor, these plaintiffs should not go without paying costs of suit.'  Thus spoke the chief justice, with a warmth of feeling which went to the heart of every spectator. Several of the senators delivered their sentiments in terms a little different, but    to the same purpose with their head; and only one or two remained still under the cloud of prejudice, but did not venture to say one word. 
BoswJDS.txt	18	4320.0	1767	Boswell, James, 1740-1795	DORANDO A SPANISH TALE.	The spectators could not contain their joy, but shouted as at a bullfight, or any other of the superb spectacles of Spain. Most of the windows of Sevile were that evening illuminated, and bonefires blazed in every corner of the city, while health and prosperity was drunk to the prince Ferdinand of Dorando.  Stung to the quick, the Arvidoso train gnashed their teeth in rage and despair. They however carried their cause by appeal, before the grandees of Spain at Madrid; but it only served to make their desperate scheme fall upon their own heads with redoubled vengeance. That illustrious assembly could hardly hear them    with patience. One of the grandees muttered, that the Arvidoso party had said strong things, that they had a heavy memorial. 'Heavy! cryed the chancellor of Spain, with a violence that made his brother shrink within himself. Heavy! yes it is heavy; but heavy as was chaos,'  Nec quicquam, nise pondus iners, congestaque eodem  Non bene junctarum discordia semina rerum.  An illustrious grandee the greatest minister that Spain ever saw, and whose eloquence vied with that of the orators of Greece and Rome, rose up, and looking around him with a piercing eye he thus began 'Though long accustomed to hold with a steady hand the balance of Europe, and mark the fate of nations; I confess, most mighty signors, that I have at no time been more affected than I now am by    this private question Private, did I say?

And if a succession should open to these children shall we at the distance of twelve, fourteen, or perhaps twenty years, allow foreign proofs to be imported to deprive them of their estate, and their very name? No, signors! While my blood is warm, I hope Spain shall never adopt such unjustifiable measures. I speak with more confidence, that upon this occasion, I see not the least doubt. The defendant's honour is cleared from every stain; and as I heartily disapprove of the temerity of the plaintiffs, I think we should award the defendant very large costs of suit, that those who bring such    odious actions before us may see what sort of a reception they are to meet with The court of Sevile has been too indulgent It is true, the prince of Arvidoso is a minor; but let him call his guardians to account when he comes of age. In this great assembly we are moved by no particular considerations we know no private parties our views are enlarged and extensive let our sentence be issued with the proper authority of the grandees of Spain.'  The whole assembly, except a very few, unanimously agreed with the eloquent minister and by a great majority it was carried, that the plaintiff should pay 50000 zechins as costs of suit. Thus was the prince Ferdinand of Dorando raised to the illustrious state of which he had been so long deprived. His dignity sat very    easy upon him, for it was natural to him. Envy and malevolene gradually decayed; and even his bitterest enemies began to repent. 
BoswJDS.txt	22	5.0	1767	Boswell, James, 1740-1795	DORANDO A SPANISH TALE.	During the heat and hurry of this adventure, the two princes had totally forgot all family differences; and indeed had hardly time to recollect their own quality. They now stood for a minute and looked at each other, when Arvidoso, with tears of gratitude in his eyes, run up, and throwing himself into the arms of Dorando; 'Generous prince, said he, forgive what is past, I am not to blame; let there be henceforth an everlasting    friendship between us.' Dorando embraced him with equal cordiality and told him 'That he wished for nothing more than what he now had obtained The friendship of so amiable a prince.'  In the mean time the attendants of Arvidoso, who had been left far behind, came up. They had been in great apprehensions for their prince. But how were they astonished and confounded, when they saw him with the prince of Dorando! They stopt short and were at a loss what to do. The prince of Arvidoso perceived it, and calling to them to approach, he advanced walking arm in arm with the prince of Dorando, and told his attendants what had happened, saying, 'Gentlemen, you now see my deliverer and best friend.'    The prince of Dorando saluted the company with a graceful ease; and turning to the prince of Arvidoso, 'Sir, said he, your highness has been pleased to call me your friend Let me have a proof that you are in earnest.
BoswJDS.txt	23	2628000.0	1767	Boswell, James, 1740-1795	DORANDO A SPANISH TALE.	My castle is nearer than yours, and I hope you will do me the honour to be my guest for this night? And I insist upon it that your company shall also go with us.'  It was accordingly agreed, and they all went to the castle of Dorando, where they were sumptuously entertained. After supper, when warm a little with wine, the two princes retired to a window, where, after talking a few minutes in private, prince Arvidoso made a sign to Don Pedro to join them. When he came, the prince Arvidoso said to the    prince Dorando, 'Allow me to present to your highness this gentleman, he is worthy of your esteem, and his candour is such, that I have convinced him he was in the wrong to you; for young as I am, I have studied with great application the cause in which both of us were so much concerned; and I give you my word, that I have always declared my opinion, that it was an injurious process. I have only to ask one favour of you, my dear prince, which is, that you may not give my mother as much trouble as our family has given yours.'  Dorando assured Don Pedro that he heartily forgave him, and as he knew him to be a man of parts would be glad to show him every mark of his attention. This done, they returned to the table. Dorando    grew exceedingly g y. He gave them several strokes of pleasantry on their famous cause; and turning to Rodomontado, said with a very sly look, ? 'What say you to it, my old Trojan? Will you be tossed from the tower of Toledo now?'  From that time foreward, the greatest intimacy subsisted between the two families. The prince of Dorando married a lady of great beauty and merit and continued in dignity and in lustre the race of his ancestors.  FINIS.

I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking.    I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this feeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes. Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is forever visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour. There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes.

I may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent forever. I shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his native river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.

Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. During the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders, as a restorative for her weakened frame.    From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born at Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained for several years their only child. Much as they were attached to each other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother's tender caresses and my father's smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something better—their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled their duties towards me.
ShelMF.txt	76	788400.0	1818	Shelley, Mary	Frankenstein	  M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.    Clerval had never sympathized in my tastes for natural science; and his literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me. He came to the university with the design of making himself complete master of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for the plan of life he had marked out for himself. Resolved to pursue no inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording scope for his spirit of enterprise. The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit languages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on the same studies. Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists. I did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for I did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary amusement. I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well repaid my labours. Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy elevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of any other country. When you read their writings, life appears to consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,—in the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart. How different from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome! 
ShelMF.txt	90	2.0	1818	Shelley, Mary	Frankenstein	  "She most of all," said Ernest, "requires consolation; she accused herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her very wretched. But since the murderer has been discovered—"    "The murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be? who could attempt to pursue him? It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw. I saw him too; he was free last night!"    "I do not know what you mean," replied my brother, in accents of wonder, "but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery. No one would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed, who would credit that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family, could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?"    "Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it is wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?"    "No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have almost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear, leaves no hope for doubt. But she will be tried today, and you will then hear all." 
ShelMF.txt	105	180.0	1818	Shelley, Mary	Frankenstein	  From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and voiceless grief of my Elizabeth. This also was my doing! And my father's woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was the work of my thrice-accursed hands! Ye weep, unhappy ones, but these are not your last tears! Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard! Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear countenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life in serving you—he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!    Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair, I beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and Justine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.

A woman was sleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the loveliness of youth and health. Here, I thought, is one of those whose joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me. And then I bent over her and whispered, 'Awake, fairest, thy lover is near—he who would give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my beloved, awake!'    "The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me. Should she indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer? Thus would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me. The thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within me—not I, but she, shall suffer; the murder I have committed because I am forever robbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone. The crime had its source in her; be hers the punishment! Thanks to the lessons of Felix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to work mischief. I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of the folds of her dress. She moved again, and I fled. 
ShelMF.txt	185	2.0	1818	Shelley, Mary	Frankenstein	  A fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently he calmed himself and proceeded—    "I intended to reason. This passion is detrimental to me, for you do not reflect that YOU are the cause of its excess. If any being felt emotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and a hundredfold; for that one creature's sake I would make peace with the whole kind! But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realized. What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of another sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it is all that I can receive, and it shall content me. It is true, we shall be monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more attached to one another. Our lives will not be happy, but they will be harmless and free from the misery I now feel. Oh! My creator, make me happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit! Let me see that I excite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my request!"

But a blight had come over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest was so terribly profound. Company was irksome to me; when alone, I could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of Henry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace. But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to my heart. I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my fellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and Justine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled my soul with anguish.    But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive and anxious to gain experience and instruction. The difference of manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of instruction and amusement. He was also pursuing an object he had long had in view. His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had in his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had taken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of European colonization and trade. In Britain only could he further the execution of his plan.

But you will, I hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge."    "That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, become the most miserable of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am and have been, can death be any evil to me?"    "Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonizing than the strange chances that have lately occurred. You were thrown, by some surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality, seized immediately, and charged with murder. The first sight that was presented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so unaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across your path." 
ShelMF.txt	242	30240.0	1818	Shelley, Mary	Frankenstein	        Chapter 22    The voyage came to an end. We landed, and proceeded to Paris. I soon found that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I could continue my journey. My father's care and attentions were indefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill. He wished me to seek amusement in society. I abhorred the face of man. Oh, not abhorred! They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt attracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an angelic nature and celestial mechanism. But I felt that I had no right to share their intercourse. I had unchained an enemy among them whose joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans. How they would, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world did they know my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!    My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by various arguments to banish my despair. Sometimes he thought that I felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride. 
ShelMF.txt	255	1440.0	1818	Shelley, Mary	Frankenstein	  Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all reflection upon melancholy subjects. But her temper was fluctuating; joy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place to distraction and reverie.    The sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the lower hills. The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary. The spire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.    The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity, sank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the shore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and hay. The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched the shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp me and cling to me forever.          Chapter 23    It was eight o'clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn and contemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured in darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines. 
ShelMF.txt	270	45360.0	1818	Shelley, Mary	Frankenstein	  I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the daemon generally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the country chiefly collected. In other places human beings were seldom seen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my path. I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers by distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed, which, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had provided me with fire and utensils for cooking.    My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during sleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! Often, when most miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of happiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived of this respite, I should have sunk under my hardships. During the day I was sustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my friends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth's voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth. Often, when wearied by a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should come and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends.
ShelMF.txt	288	180.0	1818	Shelley, Mary	Frankenstein	  It was long before he was restored, and I often thought that life was entirely extinct. At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with difficulty and was unable to speak. The surgeon gave him a composing draught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed. In the meantime he told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live.    His sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be patient. I sat by his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near, said, "Alas! The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being. Think not, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning hatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; but I feel myself justified in desiring the death of my adversary. During these last days I have been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it blamable. In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and was bound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and well-being. 
ShelMF.txt	297	2.0	1818	Shelley, Mary	Frankenstein	  "Light, feeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must I find my happiness. Some years ago, when the images which this world affords first opened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to me, I should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation. Polluted by crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in death?    "Farewell! I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these eyes will ever behold. Farewell, Frankenstein! If thou wert yet alive and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better satiated in my life than in my destruction. But it was not so; thou didst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness; and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think and feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than that which I feel. Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to thine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my wounds until death shall close them forever. 
ShelMF.txt	298	8.0	1818	Shelley, Mary	Frankenstein	  "But soon," he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, "I shall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt. Soon these burning miseries will be extinct. I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and exult in the agony of the torturing flames. The light of that conflagration will fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds. My spirit will sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus. Farewell."    He sprang from the cabin window as he said this, upon the ice raft which lay close to the vessel. He was soon borne away by the waves and lost in darkness and distance.     
godsofmars.txt	0	6307200.0	1913	Burroughs, Edgar Rice	The Gods of Mars	    FOREWORD      Twelve years had passed since I had laid the body of my great-uncle,  Captain John Carter, of Virginia, away from the sight of men in that  strange mausoleum in the old cemetery at Richmond.    Often had I pondered on the odd instructions he had left me governing  the construction of his mighty tomb, and especially those parts which  directed that he be laid in an _open_ casket and that the ponderous  mechanism which controlled the bolts of the vault's huge door be  accessible _only from the inside_.    Twelve years had passed since I had read the remarkable manuscript of  this remarkable man; this man who remembered no childhood and who could  not even offer a vague guess as to his age; who was always young and  yet who had dandled my grandfather's great-grandfather upon his knee;  this man who had spent ten years upon the planet Mars; who had fought  for the green men of Barsoom and fought against them; who had fought  for and against the red men and who had won the ever beautiful Dejah  Thoris, Princess of Helium, for his wife, and for nearly ten years had  been a prince of the house of Tardos Mors, Jeddak of Helium. 
godsofmars.txt	1	6307200.0	1913	Burroughs, Edgar Rice	The Gods of Mars	  Twelve years had passed since his body had been found upon the bluff  before his cottage overlooking the Hudson, and oft-times during these  long years I had wondered if John Carter were really dead, or if he  again roamed the dead sea bottoms of that dying planet; if he had  returned to Barsoom to find that he had opened the frowning portals of  the mighty atmosphere plant in time to save the countless millions who  were dying of asphyxiation on that far-gone day that had seen him  hurtled ruthlessly through forty-eight million miles of space back to  Earth once more.  I had wondered if he had found his black-haired  Princess and the slender son he had dreamed was with her in the royal  gardens of Tardos Mors, awaiting his return.    Or, had he found that he had been too late, and thus gone back to a  living death upon a dead world?  Or was he really dead after all, never  to return either to his mother Earth or his beloved Mars?    Thus was I lost in useless speculation one sultry August evening when  old Ben, my body servant, handed me a telegram.  Tearing it open I read:      'Meet me to-morrow hotel Raleigh Richmond.    'JOHN CARTER'      Early the next morning I took the first train for Richmond and within  two hours was being ushered into the room occupied by John Carter. 
godsofmars.txt	9	30.0	1913	Burroughs, Edgar Rice	The Gods of Mars	The wood of some of the trees was as black as ebony, while their  nearest neighbours might perhaps gleam in the subdued light of the  forest as clear and white as the finest china, or, again, they were  azure, scarlet, yellow, or deepest purple.    And in the same way was the foliage as gay and variegated as the stems,  while the blooms that clustered thick upon them may not be described in  any earthly tongue, and indeed might challenge the language of the gods.    As I neared the confines of the forest I beheld before me and between  the grove and the open sea, a broad expanse of meadow land, and as I  was about to emerge from the shadows of the trees a sight met my eyes  that banished all romantic and poetic reflection upon the beauties of  the strange landscape.    To my left the sea extended as far as the eye could reach, before me  only a vague, dim line indicated its further shore, while at my right a  mighty river, broad, placid, and majestic, flowed between scarlet banks  to empty into the quiet sea before me.    At a little distance up the river rose mighty perpendicular bluffs,  from the very base of which the great river seemed to rise.    But it was not these inspiring and magnificent evidences of Nature's  grandeur that took my immediate attention from the beauties of the  forest.  It was the sight of a score of figures moving slowly about the  meadow near the bank of the mighty river. 
godsofmars.txt	18	1.0	1913	Burroughs, Edgar Rice	The Gods of Mars	  As I had watched the noble fight which the great warrior had put up  against such enormous odds my heart had swelled in admiration for him,  and acting as I am wont to do, more upon impulse than after mature  deliberation, I instantly sprang from my sheltering rock and bounded  quickly toward the bodies of the dead green Martians, a well-defined  plan of action already formed.    Half a dozen great leaps brought me to the spot, and another instant  saw me again in my stride in quick pursuit of the hideous monsters that  were rapidly gaining on the fleeing warrior, but this time I grasped a  mighty long-sword in my hand and in my heart was the old blood lust of  the fighting man, and a red mist swam before my eyes and I felt my lips  respond to my heart in the old smile that has ever marked me in the  midst of the joy of battle.    Swift as I was I was none too soon, for the green warrior had been  overtaken ere he had made half the distance to the forest, and now he  stood with his back to a boulder, while the herd, temporarily balked,  hissed and screeched about him.    With their single eyes in the centre of their heads and every eye  turned upon their prey, they did not note my soundless approach, so  that I was upon them with my great long-sword and four of them lay dead  ere they knew that I was among them. 
godsofmars.txt	53	2.0	1913	Burroughs, Edgar Rice	The Gods of Mars	  I had not long to wait, for presently the golden surface commenced to  move rapidly.  Scarcely had it started than I gave the signal to Tars  Tarkas, simultaneously springing for the receding half of the pivoting  door.  In like manner the Thark wheeled and leaped for the opening  being made by the inswinging section.    A single bound carried me completely through into the adjoining room  and brought me face to face with the fellow whose cruel face I had seen  before.  He was about my own height and well muscled and in every  outward detail moulded precisely as are Earth men.    At his side hung a long-sword, a short-sword, a dagger, and one of the  destructive radium revolvers that are common upon Mars.    The fact that I was armed only with a long-sword, and so according to  the laws and ethics of battle everywhere upon Barsoom should only have  been met with a similar or lesser weapon, seemed to have no effect upon  the moral sense of my enemy, for he whipped out his revolver ere I  scarce had touched the floor by his side, but an uppercut from my  long-sword sent it flying from his grasp before he could discharge it.    Instantly he drew his long-sword, and thus evenly armed we set to in  earnest for one of the closest battles I ever have fought.    The fellow was a marvellous swordsman and evidently in practice, while  I had not gripped the hilt of a sword for ten long years before that  morning. 
godsofmars.txt	79	4.0	1913	Burroughs, Edgar Rice	The Gods of Mars	  "It was midnight when you released me from my chains," said Thuvia.  "Two hours later we reached the storeroom.  There you slept for  fourteen hours.  It must now be nearly sundown again.  Come, we will go  to some nearby window in the cliff and make sure."    So saying, she led the way through winding corridors until at a sudden  turn we came upon an opening which overlooked the Valley Dor.    At our right the sun was setting, a huge red orb, below the western  range of Otz.  A little below us stood the Holy Thern on watch upon his  balcony.  His scarlet robe of office was pulled tightly about him in  anticipation of the cold that comes so suddenly with darkness as the  sun sets.  So rare is the atmosphere of Mars that it absorbs very  little heat from the sun.  During the daylight hours it is always  extremely hot; at night it is intensely cold.  Nor does the thin  atmosphere refract the sun's rays or diffuse its light as upon Earth.  There is no twilight on Mars.  When the great orb of day disappears  beneath the horizon the effect is precisely as that of the  extinguishing of a single lamp within a chamber.  From brilliant light  you are plunged without warning into utter darkness.  Then the moons  come; the mysterious, magic moons of Mars, hurtling like monster  meteors low across the face of the planet. 
godsofmars.txt	100	2.0	1913	Burroughs, Edgar Rice	The Gods of Mars	  Instead I held grimly to him, choking, ever choking, while his frantic  struggles dragged me lower and lower toward the end of the chain.    Gradually his contortions became spasmodic, lessening by degrees until  they ceased entirely.  Then I released my hold upon him and in an  instant he was swallowed by the black shadows far below.    Again I climbed to the ship's rail.  This time I succeeded in raising  my eyes to the level of the deck, where I could take a careful survey  of the conditions immediately confronting me.    The nearer moon had passed below the horizon, but the clear effulgence  of the further satellite bathed the deck of the cruiser, bringing into  sharp relief the bodies of six or eight black men sprawled about in  sleep.    Huddled close to the base of a rapid fire gun was a young white girl,  securely bound.  Her eyes were widespread in an expression of horrified  anticipation and fixed directly upon me as I came in sight above the  edge of the deck.    Unutterable relief instantly filled them as they fell upon the mystic  jewel which sparkled in the centre of my stolen headpiece.  She did not  speak.  Instead her eyes warned me to beware the sleeping figures that  surrounded her.    Noiselessly I gained the deck.  The girl nodded to me to approach her.  As I bent low she whispered to me to release her. 
godsofmars.txt	171	1.0	1913	Burroughs, Edgar Rice	The Gods of Mars	  The racks that stood without were stripped of the swords with which the  prisoners were to have been armed to enter their allotted combats, and  a swarm of determined warriors sped to our support.    The great apes, towering in all their fifteen feet of height, had gone  down before my sword while the charging guards were still some distance  away.  Close behind them pursued the youth.  At my back were the young  girls, and as it was in their service that I fought, I remained  standing there to meet my inevitable death, but with the determination  to give such an account of myself as would long be remembered in the  land of the First Born.    I noted the marvellous speed of the young red man as he raced after the  guards.  Never had I seen such speed in any Martian.  His leaps and  bounds were little short of those which my earthly muscles had produced  to create such awe and respect on the part of the green Martians into  whose hands I had fallen on that long-gone day that had seen my first  advent upon Mars.    The guards had not reached me when he fell upon them from the rear, and  as they turned, thinking from the fierceness of his onslaught that a  dozen were attacking them, I rushed them from my side. 
godsofmars.txt	204	2.0	1913	Burroughs, Edgar Rice	The Gods of Mars	The cruiser, already tilted at a perilous angle, was carried completely  over backward by the impact of my smaller vessel.  Her crew fell  twisting and screaming through the air to the water far below, while  the cruiser, her propellers still madly churning, dived swiftly  headforemost after them to the bottom of the Sea of Omean.    The collision crushed our steel bows, and notwithstanding every effort  on our part came near to hurling us from the deck.  As it was we landed  in a wildly clutching heap at the very extremity of the flier, where  Xodar and I succeeded in grasping the hand-rail, but the boy would have  plunged overboard had I not fortunately grasped his ankle as he was  already partially over.    Unguided, our vessel careened wildly in its mad flight, rising ever  nearer the rocks above.  It took but an instant, however, for me to  regain the levers, and with the roof barely fifty feet above I turned  her nose once more into the horizontal plane and headed her again for  the black mouth of the shaft.    The collision had retarded our progress and now a hundred swift scouts  were close upon us.  Xodar had told me that ascending the shaft by  virtue of our repulsive rays alone would give our enemies their best  chance to overtake us, since our propellers would be idle and in rising  we would be outclassed by many of our pursuers.  The swifter craft are  seldom equipped with large buoyancy tanks, since the added bulk of them  tends to reduce a vessel's speed. 
godsofmars.txt	208	1.0	1913	Burroughs, Edgar Rice	The Gods of Mars	  I said as much to Xodar, over my shoulder.    "It is very wonderful, nevertheless," he replied.  "No one else could  have accomplished it but John Carter."    At the sound of that name the boy jumped to his feet.    "John Carter!" he cried.  "John Carter!  Why, man, John Carter, Prince  of Helium, has been dead for years.  I am his son."          CHAPTER XIV    THE EYES IN THE DARK      My son!  I could not believe my ears.  Slowly I rose and faced the  handsome youth.  Now that I looked at him closely I commenced to see  why his face and personality had attracted me so strongly.  There was  much of his mother's incomparable beauty in his clear-cut features, but  it was strongly masculine beauty, and his grey eyes and the expression  of them were mine.    The boy stood facing me, half hope and half uncertainty in his look.    "Tell me of your mother," I said.  "Tell me all you can of the years  that I have been robbed by a relentless fate of her dear companionship."    With a cry of pleasure he sprang toward me and threw his arms about my  neck, and for a brief moment as I held my boy close to me the tears  welled to my eyes and I was like to have choked after the manner of  some maudlin fool--but I do not regret it, nor am I ashamed.  A long  life has taught me that a man may seem weak where women and children  are concerned and yet be anything but a weakling in the sterner avenues  of life. 
godsofmars.txt	228	1.0	1913	Burroughs, Edgar Rice	The Gods of Mars	  At that moment I caught another glimpse from the corner of my eye of  the single pair of eyes at my back making a sudden rush upon me.  I  turned to meet the charge; there was a quick rush of the three from the  other direction; but I determined to pursue the single pair until I  should have at least settled my account with one of the beasts and thus  be relieved of the strain of meeting attacks from both directions.    There was no sound in the corridor, only that of my own breathing, yet  I knew that those three uncanny creatures were almost upon me.  The  eyes in front were not retreating so rapidly now; I was almost within  sword reach of them.  I raised my sword arm to deal the blow that  should free me, and then I felt a heavy body upon my back.  A cold,  moist, slimy something fastened itself upon my throat.  I stumbled and  went down.          CHAPTER XV    FLIGHT AND PURSUIT      I could not have been unconscious more than a few seconds, and yet I  know that I was unconscious, for the next thing I realized was that a  growing radiance was illuminating the corridor about me and the eyes  were gone.    I was unharmed except for a slight bruise upon my forehead where it had  struck the stone flagging as I fell. 
godsofmars.txt	234	3.0	1913	Burroughs, Edgar Rice	The Gods of Mars	  "Yes.  I found him in the prison of Shador, on the Sea of Omean, in the  land of the First Born."    "I know not any of these places, John Carter.  Be they upon Barsoom?"    "Upon and below, my friend; but wait until we shall have made good our  escape, and you shall hear the strangest narrative that ever a  Barsoomian of the outer world gave ear to.  Now we must steal our  thoats and be well away to the north before these fellows discover how  we have tricked them."    In safety we reached the great gates at the far end of the courtyard,  through which it was necessary to take our thoats to the avenue beyond.  It is no easy matter to handle five of these great, fierce beasts,  which by nature are as wild and ferocious as their masters and held in  subjection by cruelty and brute force alone.    As we approached them they sniffed our unfamiliar scent and with  squeals of rage circled about us.  Their long, massive necks upreared  raised their great, gaping mouths high above our heads.  They are  fearsome appearing brutes at best, but when they are aroused they are  fully as dangerous as they look.  The thoat stands a good ten feet at  the shoulder.  His hide is sleek and hairless, and of a dark slate  colour on back and sides, shading down his eight legs to a vivid yellow  at the huge, padded, nailless feet; the belly is pure white.  A broad,  flat tail, larger at the tip than at the root, completes the picture of  this ferocious green Martian mount--a fit war steed for these warlike  people. 
godsofmars.txt	280	1.0	1913	Burroughs, Edgar Rice	The Gods of Mars	  "John Carter," he said, "by the edict of custom, by the law of our  religion, and by the verdict of an impartial court, you are condemned  to die.  The people cannot save you--I alone may accomplish that.  You  are absolutely in my power to do with as I wish--I may kill you, or I  may free you, and should I elect to kill you, none would be the wiser.    "Should you go free in Helium for a year, in accordance with the  conditions of your reprieve, there is little fear that the people would  ever insist upon the execution of the sentence imposed upon you.    "You may go free within two minutes, upon one condition.  Tardos Mors  will never return to Helium.  Neither will Mors Kajak, nor Dejah  Thoris.  Helium must select a new Jeddak within the year.  Zat Arrras  would be Jeddak of Helium.  Say that you will espouse my cause.  This  is the price of your freedom.  I am done."    I knew it was within the scope of Zat Arrras' cruel heart to destroy me,  and if I were dead I could see little reason to doubt that he might  easily become Jeddak of Helium.  Free, I could prosecute the search for  Dejah Thoris.  Were I dead, my brave comrades might not be able to  carry out our plans.  So, by refusing to accede to his request, it was  quite probable that not only would I not prevent him from becoming  Jeddak of Helium, but that I would be the means of sealing Dejah  Thoris' fate--of consigning her, through my refusal, to the horrors of  the arena of Issus. 
godsofmars.txt	281	1.0	1913	Burroughs, Edgar Rice	The Gods of Mars	  For a moment I was perplexed, but for a moment only.  The proud  daughter of a thousand Jeddaks would choose death to a dishonorable  alliance such as this, nor could John Carter do less for Helium than  his Princess would do.    Then I turned to Zat Arrras.    "There can be no alliance," I said, "between a traitor to Helium and a  prince of the House of Tardos Mors.  I do not believe, Zat Arrras, that  the great Jeddak is dead."    Zat Arrras shrugged his shoulders.    "It will not be long, John Carter," he said, "that your opinions will  be of interest even to yourself, so make the best of them while you  can.  Zat Arrras will permit you in due time to reflect further upon the  magnanimous offer he has made you.  Into the silence and darkness of  the pits you will enter upon your reflection this night with the  knowledge that should you fail within a reasonable time to agree to the  alternative which has been offered you, never shall you emerge from the  darkness and the silence again.  Nor shall you know at what minute the  hand will reach out through the darkness and the silence with the keen  dagger that shall rob you of your last chance to win again the warmth  and the freedom and joyousness of the outer world."    Zat Arrras clapped his hands as he ceased speaking.  The guards returned. 
godsofmars.txt	343	1.4	1913	Burroughs, Edgar Rice	The Gods of Mars	And as she finished speaking I saw her raise a dagger on high, and then I saw another figure.  It was Thuvia's.  As the dagger fell toward the unprotected breast of my love, Thuvia was almost between them.  A blinding gust of smoke blotted out the tragedy within that fearsome cell--a shriek rang out, a single shriek, as the dagger fell.The smoke cleared away, but we stood gazing upon a blank wall.  The last crevice had closed, and for a long year that hideous chamber would retain its secret from the eyes of men. They urged me to leave.
godsofmars.txt	344	10.0	1913	Burroughs, Edgar Rice	The Gods of Mars	  "Go," I urged them.  "Let me die here beside my Princess--there is no  hope or happiness elsewhere for me.  When they carry her dear body from  that terrible place a year hence let them find the body of her lord  awaiting her."    Of what happened after that I have only a confused recollection.  It  seems as though I struggled with many men, and then that I was picked  bodily from the ground and borne away.  I do not know.  I have never  asked, nor has any other who was there that day intruded on my sorrow  or recalled to my mind the occurrences which they know could but at  best reopen the terrible wound within my heart.    Ah!  If I could but know one thing, what a burden of suspense would be  lifted from my shoulders!  But whether the assassin's dagger reached  one fair bosom or another, only time will divulge.

CONTAINING AS MUCH OF THE BIRTH OF THE FOUNDLING AS IS NECESSARY OR  PROPER TO ACQUAINT THE READER WITH IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS HISTORY.        Chapter i.    The introduction to the work, or bill of fare to the feast.      An author ought to consider himself, not as a gentleman who gives a  private or eleemosynary treat, but rather as one who keeps a public  ordinary, at which all persons are welcome for their money. In the  former case, it is well known that the entertainer provides what fare  he pleases; and though this should be very indifferent, and utterly  disagreeable to the taste of his company, they must not find any  fault; nay, on the contrary, good breeding forces them outwardly to  approve and to commend whatever is set before them. Now the contrary  of this happens to the master of an ordinary. Men who pay for what  they eat will insist on gratifying their palates, however nice and  whimsical these may prove; and if everything is not agreeable to their  taste, will challenge a right to censure, to abuse, and to d--n their  dinner without controul.    To prevent, therefore, giving offence to their customers by any such  disappointment, it hath been usual with the honest and well-meaning  host to provide a bill of fare which all persons may peruse at their  first entrance into the house; and having thence acquainted themselves  with the entertainment which they may expect, may either stay and  regale with what is provided for them, or may depart to some other  ordinary better accommodated to their taste.

The provision, then, which we have here made is no other than _Human  Nature_. Nor do I fear that my sensible reader, though most luxurious  in his taste, will start, cavil, or be offended, because I have named  but one article. The tortoise--as the alderman of Bristol, well  learned in eating, knows by much experience--besides the delicious  calipash and calipee, contains many different kinds of food; nor can  the learned reader be ignorant, that in human nature, though here  collected under one general name, is such prodigious variety, that a  cook will have sooner gone through all the several species of animal  and vegetable food in the world, than an author will be able to  exhaust so extensive a subject.    An objection may perhaps be apprehended from the more delicate, that  this dish is too common and vulgar; for what else is the subject of  all the romances, novels, plays, and poems, with which the stalls  abound? Many exquisite viands might be rejected by the epicure, if it  was a sufficient cause for his contemning of them as common and  vulgar, that something was to be found in the most paltry alleys under  the same name. In reality, true nature is as difficult to be met with  in authors, as the Bayonne ham, or Bologna sausage, is to be found in  the shops.

But as we cannot possibly divine what complection our reader may be  of, and as it will be some time before he will hear any more of Jenny,  we think proper to give him a very early intimation, that Mr Allworthy  was, and will hereafter appear to be, absolutely innocent of any  criminal intention whatever. He had indeed committed no other than an  error in politics, by tempering justice with mercy, and by refusing to  gratify the good-natured disposition of the mob,[*] with an object for  their compassion to work on in the person of poor Jenny, whom, in  order to pity, they desired to have seen sacrificed to ruin and  infamy, by a shameful correction in Bridewell.      [*]Whenever this word occurs in our writings, it intends persons    without virtue or sense, in all stations; and many of the highest    rank are often meant by it.

Now it is our purpose, in the ensuing pages, to pursue a contrary  method. When any extraordinary scene presents itself (as we trust will  often be the case), we shall spare no pains nor paper to open it at  large to our reader; but if whole years should pass without producing  anything worthy his notice, we shall not be afraid of a chasm in our  history; but shall hasten on to matters of consequence, and leave such  periods of time totally unobserved.

This good woman was, no more than Othello, of a disposition                To make a life of jealousy       And follow still the changes of the moon       With fresh suspicions--    With her, as well as him,              --To be once in doubt,       Was once to be resolvd--    she therefore ordered Jenny immediately to pack up her alls and  begone, for that she was determined she should not sleep that night  within her walls.

The gamekeeper having exerted as much diligence in quest of the lost  goods, as if he had hoped to find them, desired Mr Jones to recollect  if he had been in no other place: "For sure," said he, "if you had  lost them here so lately, the things must have been here still; for  this is a very unlikely place for any one to pass by." And indeed it  was by great accident that he himself had passed through that field,  in order to lay wires for hares, with which he was to supply a  poulterer at Bath the next morning.    Jones now gave over all hopes of recovering his loss, and almost all  thoughts concerning it, and turning to Black George, asked him  earnestly if he would do him the greatest favour in the world?

He had entered  very young into the army, and had served in the capacity of an ensign  at the battle of Tannieres; here he had received two wounds, and had  so well distinguished himself, that he was by the Duke of Marlborough  advanced to be a lieutenant, immediately after that battle.    In this commission he had continued ever since, viz., near forty  years; during which time he had seen vast numbers preferred over his  head, and had now the mortification to be commanded by boys, whose  fathers were at nurse when he first entered into the service.    Nor was this ill success in his profession solely owing to his having  no friends among the men in power. He had the misfortune to incur the  displeasure of his colonel, who for many years continued in the  command of this regiment. Nor did he owe the implacable ill-will which  this man bore him to any neglect or deficiency as an officer, nor  indeed to any fault in himself; but solely to the indiscretion of his  wife, who was a very beautiful woman, and who, though she was  remarkably fond of her husband, would not purchase his preferment at  the expense of certain favours which the colonel required of her.

Susan departed, and soon returned with an account that the two  gentlemen were got both into the same bed. "Two gentlemen," says the  landlady, "in the same bed! that's impossible; they are two arrant  scrubs, I warrant them; and I believe young Squire Allworthy guessed  right, that the fellow intended to rob her ladyship; for, if he had  broke open the lady's door with any of the wicked designs of a  gentleman, he would never have sneaked away to another room to save  the expense of a supper and a bed to himself. They are certainly  thieves, and their searching after a wife is nothing but a pretence."    In these censures my landlady did Mr Fitzpatrick great injustice; for  he was really born a gentleman, though not worth a groat; and though,  perhaps, he had some few blemishes in his heart as well as in his  head, yet being a sneaking or a niggardly fellow was not one of them.  In reality, he was so generous a man, that, whereas he had received a  very handsome fortune with his wife, he had now spent every penny of  it, except some little pittance which was settled upon her; and, in  order to possess himself of this, he had used her with such cruelty,  that, together with his jealousy, which was of the bitterest kind, it  had forced the poor woman to run away from him.

Old England  for ever! ten thousand French, my brave lad! I am going to tap away  directly."    This news determined the opinion of the wise man, and he resolved to  make his court to the young lady when she arose; for he had now (he  said) discovered that she was no other than Madam Jenny Cameron  herself.      Chapter iii.    A very short chapter, in which however is a sun, a moon, a star, and  an angel.      The sun (for he keeps very good hours at this time of the year) had  been some time retired to rest when Sophia arose greatly refreshed by  her sleep; which, short as it was, nothing but her extreme fatigue  could have occasioned; for, though she had told her maid, and perhaps  herself too, that she was perfectly easy when she left Upton, yet it  is certain her mind was a little affected with that malady which is  attended with all the restless symptoms of a fever, and is perhaps the  very distemper which physicians mean (if they mean anything) by the  fever on the spirits. 
tomjones.txt	886	1.0	1749	Fielding, Henry, 1707-1754	The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling	  Virgil, I think, tells us, that when the mob are assembled in a  riotous and tumultuous manner, and all sorts of missile weapons fly  about, if a man of gravity and authority appears amongst them, the  tumult is presently appeased, and the mob, which when collected into  one body, may be well compared to an ass, erect their long ears at the  grave man's discourse.    On the contrary, when a set of grave men and philosophers are  disputing; when wisdom herself may in a manner be considered as  present, and administering arguments to the disputants; should a  tumult arise among the mob, or should one scold, who is herself equal  in noise to a mighty mob, appear among the said philosophers; their  disputes cease in a moment, wisdom no longer performs her ministerial  office, and the attention of every one is immediately attracted by the  scold alone.    Thus the uproar aforesaid, and the arrival of the landlady, silenced  the master of the puppet-show, and put a speedy and final end to that  grave and solemn harangue, of which we have given the reader a  sufficient taste already. Nothing indeed could have happened so very  inopportune as this accident; the most wanton malice of fortune could  not have contrived such another stratagem to confound the poor fellow,  while he was so triumphantly descanting on the good morals inculcated  by his exhibitions. His mouth was now as effectually stopt, as that of  quack must be, if, in the midst of a declamation on the great virtues  of his pills and powders, the corpse of one of his martyrs should be  brought forth, and deposited before the stage, as a testimony of his  skill. 
tomjones.txt	983	2.0	1749	Fielding, Henry, 1707-1754	The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling	  Though a gentle sigh, which stole from the bosom of Nancy, seemed to  argue some secret disapprobation of these sentiments, she did not dare  openly to oppose them. For as this good woman had all the tenderness,  so she had preserved all the authority of a parent; and as her  indulgence to the desires of her children was restrained only by her  fears for their safety and future welfare, so she never suffered those  commands which proceeded from such fears to be either disobeyed or  disputed. And this the young gentleman, who had lodged two years in  the house, knew so well, that he presently acquiesced in the refusal.    Mr Nightingale, who grew every minute fonder of Jones, was very  desirous of his company that day to dinner at the tavern, where he  offered to introduce him to some of his acquaintance; but Jones begged  to be excused, "as his cloaths," he said, "were not yet come to town."    To confess the truth, Mr Jones was now in a situation, which sometimes  happens to be the case of young gentlemen of much better figure than  himself. In short, he had not one penny in his pocket; a situation in  much greater credit among the antient philosophers than among the  modern wise men who live in Lombard-street, or those who frequent  White's chocolate-house. And, perhaps, the great honours which those  philosophers have ascribed to an empty pocket may be one of the  reasons of that high contempt in which they are held in the aforesaid  street and chocolate-house.

Then fetching a deep sigh, and laying hold of her hand,  he ran on for some minutes in a strain which would be little more  pleasing to the reader than it was to the lady; and at last concluded  with a declaration, "That if he was master of the world, he would lay  it at her feet." Sophia then, forcibly pulling away her hand from his,  answered with much spirit, "I promise you, sir, your world and its  master I should spurn from me with equal contempt." She then offered  to go; and Lord Fellamar, again laying hold of her hand, said, "Pardon  me, my beloved angel, freedoms which nothing but despair could have  tempted me to take.----Believe me, could I have had any hope that my  title and fortune, neither of them inconsiderable, unless when  compared with your worth, would have been accepted, I had, in the  humblest manner, presented them to your acceptance.----But I cannot  lose you.--By heaven, I will sooner part with my soul!--You are, you  must, you shall be only mine." "My lord," says she, "I intreat you to  desist from a vain pursuit; for, upon my honour, I will never hear you  on this subject. Let go my hand, my lord; for I am resolved to go from  you this moment; nor will I ever see you more." "Then, madam," cries  his lordship, "I must make the best use of this moment; for I cannot  live, nor will I live without you."----"What do you mean, my lord?"

"Go out, Betty," said Sophia.    When Betty was departed, Mrs Miller said, "I was desired, madam, by a  very unhappy young gentleman, to deliver you this letter." Sophia  changed colour when she saw the direction, well knowing the hand, and  after some hesitation, said--"I could not conceive, madam, from your  appearance, that your business had been of such a nature.--Whomever  you brought this letter from, I shall not open it. I should be sorry  to entertain an unjust suspicion of any one; but you are an utter  stranger to me."    "If you will have patience, madam," answered Mrs Miller, "I will  acquaint you who I am, and how I came by that letter." "I have no  curiosity, madam, to know anything," cries Sophia; "but I must insist  on your delivering that letter back to the person who gave it you."    Mrs Miller then fell upon her knees, and in the most passionate terms  implored her compassion; to which Sophia answered: "Sure, madam, it is  surprizing you should be so very strongly interested in the behalf of  this person. I would not think, madam"--"No, madam," says Mrs Miller,  "you shall not think anything but the truth. I will tell you all, and  you will not wonder that I am interested. He is the best-natured  creature that ever was born."--She then began and related the story of  Mr Anderson.--After this she cried, "This, madam, this is his  goodness; but I have much more tender obligations to him. He hath  preserved my child."--Here, after shedding some tears, she related  everything concerning that fact, suppressing only those circumstances  which would have most reflected on her daughter, and concluded with  saying, "Now, madam, you shall judge whether I can ever do enough for  so kind, so good, so generous a young man; and sure he is the best and  worthiest of all human beings."

"I can't say, sir," answered he, "that I am regularly a servant, but I  live with him, an't please your honour, at present. _Non sum qualis  eram_, as your honour very well knows."    Mr Allworthy then asked him many questions concerning Jones, as to his  health, and other matters; to all which Partridge answered, without  having the least regard to what was, but considered only what he would  have things appear; for a strict adherence to truth was not among the  articles of this honest fellow's morality or his religion.    During this dialogue Mr Nightingale took his leave, and presently  after Mrs Miller left the room, when Allworthy likewise despatched  Blifil; for he imagined that Partridge when alone with him would be  more explicit than before company. They were no sooner left in private  together than Allworthy began, as in the following chapter.        Chapter vi.    In which the history is farther continued      "Sure, friend," said the good man, "you are the strangest of all human  beings. Not only to have suffered as you have formerly for obstinately  persisting in a falshood, but to persist in it thus to the last, and  to pass thus upon the world for a servant of your own son! What  interest can you have in all this? What can be your motive?" 
tomjones.txt	1415	3153600.0	1749	Fielding, Henry, 1707-1754	The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling	As for Partridge, Jones hath settled £50 a-year on him; and he hath again set up a school, in which he meets with much better encouragement than formerly, and there is now a treaty of marriage on foot between him and Miss Molly Seagrim, which, through the mediationof Sophia, is likely to take effect. We now return to take leave of Mr Jones and Sophia, who, within two days after their marriage, attended Mr Western and Mr Allworthy into the country. Western hath resigned his family seat, and the greater part of his estate, to his son-in-law, and hath retired to a lesser house of his in another part of the country, which is better for hunting. Indeed, he is often as a visitant with Mr Jones, who, as well as his daughter, hath an infinite delight in doing everything in their power to please him. And this desire of theirs is attended with such success, that the old gentleman declares he was never happy in his life till now. He hath here a parlour and ante-chamber to himself, where he gets drunk with whom he pleases: and his daughter is still as ready as formerly to play to him whenever he desires it; for Jones hath assured her that, as, next to pleasing her, one of his highest satisfactions is to contribute to the happiness of the old man; so, the great duty which she expresses and performs to her father, renders her almost equally dear to him with the love which she bestows on himself.
tomjones.txt	1416	3153600.0	1749	Fielding, Henry, 1707-1754	The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling	  Sophia hath already produced him two fine children, a boy and a girl,  of whom the old gentleman is so fond, that he spends much of his time  in the nursery, where he declares the tattling of his little  grand-daughter, who is above a year and a half old, is sweeter music  than the finest cry of dogs in England.    Allworthy was likewise greatly liberal to Jones on the marriage, and  hath omitted no instance of shewing his affection to him and his lady,  who love him as a father. Whatever in the nature of Jones had a  tendency to vice, has been corrected by continual conversation with  this good man, and by his union with the lovely and virtuous Sophia.  He hath also, by reflection on his past follies, acquired a discretion  and prudence very uncommon in one of his lively parts.    To conclude, as there are not to be found a worthier man and woman,  than this fond couple, so neither can any be imagined more happy. They  preserve the purest and tenderest affection for each other, an  affection daily encreased and confirmed by mutual endearments and  mutual esteem. Nor is their conduct towards their relations and  friends less amiable than towards one another. And such is their  condescension, their indulgence, and their beneficence to those below  them, that there is not a neighbour, a tenant, or a servant, who doth  not most gratefully bless the day when Mr Jones was married to his  Sophia. 
sensesensibility.txt	0	105120000.0	1811	Austen, Jane	Sense and Sensibility	  SENSE AND SENSIBILITY    by Jane Austen    (1811)          CHAPTER 1      The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex.  Their estate  was large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre of  their property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so  respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their  surrounding acquaintance.  The late owner of this estate was a single  man, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his  life, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister.  But her  death, which happened ten years before his own, produced a great  alteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and received  into his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal  inheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended to  bequeath it.  In the society of his nephew and niece, and their  children, the old Gentleman's days were comfortably spent.  His  attachment to them all increased.  The constant attention of Mr. and  Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from  interest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid  comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the  children added a relish to his existence. 
sensesensibility.txt	1	7884000.0	1811	Austen, Jane	Sense and Sensibility	  By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his present  lady, three daughters.  The son, a steady respectable young man, was  amply provided for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large,  and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age.  By his own  marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to his  wealth.  To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not  so really important as to his sisters; for their fortune, independent  of what might arise to them from their father's inheriting that  property, could be but small.  Their mother had nothing, and their  father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal; for the  remaining moiety of his first wife's fortune was also secured to her  child, and he had only a life-interest in it.    The old gentleman died: his will was read, and like almost every other  will, gave as much disappointment as pleasure.  He was neither so  unjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his estate from his nephew;--but  he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the  bequest.  Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife  and daughters than for himself or his son;--but to his son, and his  son's son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way, as  to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear  to him, and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate, or  by any sale of its valuable woods.

She felt that Edward stood  very high in her opinion.  She believed the regard to be mutual; but  she required greater certainty of it to make Marianne's conviction of  their attachment agreeable to her.  She knew that what Marianne and her  mother conjectured one moment, they believed the next--that with them,  to wish was to hope, and to hope was to expect.  She tried to explain  the real state of the case to her sister.    "I do not attempt to deny," said she, "that I think very highly of  him--that I greatly esteem, that I like him."    Marianne here burst forth with indignation--    "Esteem him! Like him! Cold-hearted Elinor! Oh!  worse than  cold-hearted! Ashamed of being otherwise.  Use those words again, and I  will leave the room this moment."    Elinor could not help laughing.  "Excuse me," said she; "and be assured  that I meant no offence to you, by speaking, in so quiet a way, of my  own feelings.  Believe them to be stronger than I have declared;  believe them, in short, to be such as his merit, and the suspicion--the  hope of his affection for me may warrant, without imprudence or folly. 
sensesensibility.txt	134	60.0	1811	Austen, Jane	Sense and Sensibility	  Mrs. Palmer was several years younger than Lady Middleton, and totally  unlike her in every respect.  She was short and plump, had a very  pretty face, and the finest expression of good humour in it that could  possibly be.  Her manners were by no means so elegant as her sister's,  but they were much more prepossessing.  She came in with a smile,  smiled all the time of her visit, except when she laughed, and smiled  when she went away.  Her husband was a grave looking young man of five  or six and twenty, with an air of more fashion and sense than his wife,  but of less willingness to please or be pleased.  He entered the room  with a look of self-consequence, slightly bowed to the ladies, without  speaking a word, and, after briefly surveying them and their  apartments, took up a newspaper from the table, and continued to read  it as long as he staid.    Mrs. Palmer, on the contrary, who was strongly endowed by nature with a  turn for being uniformly civil and happy, was hardly seated before her  admiration of the parlour and every thing in it burst forth.    "Well! what a delightful room this is! I never saw anything so  charming!  Only think, Mama, how it is improved since I was here last!  I always thought it such a sweet place, ma'am!

"Oh! yes, quite well; and so full of your praises, he did nothing but  say fine things of you."    "I am flattered by his commendation.  He seems an excellent man; and I  think him uncommonly pleasing."    "So do I.--He is such a charming man, that it is quite a pity he should  be so grave and so dull.  Mama says HE was in love with your sister  too.-- I assure you it was a great compliment if he was, for he hardly  ever falls in love with any body."    "Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire?" said  Elinor.    "Oh! yes, extremely well; that is, I do not believe many people are  acquainted with him, because Combe Magna is so far off; but they all  think him extremely agreeable I assure you.  Nobody is more liked than  Mr. Willoughby wherever he goes, and so you may tell your sister.  She  is a monstrous lucky girl to get him, upon my honour; not but that he  is much more lucky in getting her, because she is so very handsome and  agreeable, that nothing can be good enough for her.  However, I don't  think her hardly at all handsomer than you, I assure you; for I think  you both excessively pretty, and so does Mr. Palmer too I am sure,  though we could not get him to own it last night."

And I  hope you may have as good luck yourself soon,--but perhaps you may have  a friend in the corner already."    Elinor could not suppose that Sir John would be more nice in  proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for Edward, than he had been  with respect to Marianne; indeed it was rather his favourite joke of  the two, as being somewhat newer and more conjectural; and since  Edward's visit, they had never dined together without his drinking to  her best affections with so much significancy and so many nods and  winks, as to excite general attention.  The letter F--had been likewise  invariably brought forward, and found productive of such countless  jokes, that its character as the wittiest letter in the alphabet had  been long established with Elinor.    The Miss Steeles, as she expected, had now all the benefit of these  jokes, and in the eldest of them they raised a curiosity to know the  name of the gentleman alluded to, which, though often impertinently  expressed, was perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitiveness  into the concerns of their family.  But Sir John did not sport long  with the curiosity which he delighted to raise, for he had at least as  much pleasure in telling the name, as Miss Steele had in hearing it.

She was stronger alone, and her own  good sense so well supported her, that her firmness was as unshaken,  her appearance of cheerfulness as invariable, as with regrets so  poignant and so fresh, it was possible for them to be.    Much as she had suffered from her first conversation with Lucy on the  subject, she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it; and this for  more reasons than one.  She wanted to hear many particulars of their  engagement repeated again, she wanted more clearly to understand what  Lucy really felt for Edward, whether there were any sincerity in her  declaration of tender regard for him, and she particularly wanted to  convince Lucy, by her readiness to enter on the matter again, and her  calmness in conversing on it, that she was no otherwise interested in  it than as a friend, which she very much feared her involuntary  agitation, in their morning discourse, must have left at least  doubtful.  That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very  probable: it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in her  praise, not merely from Lucy's assertion, but from her venturing to  trust her on so short a personal acquaintance, with a secret so  confessedly and evidently important.  And even Sir John's joking  intelligence must have had some weight.  But indeed, while Elinor  remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by  Edward, it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it  natural that Lucy should be jealous; and that she was so, her very  confidence was a proof.  What other reason for the disclosure of the  affair could there be, but that Elinor might be informed by it of  Lucy's superior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid him in future?

On being informed of the invitation, Mrs. Dashwood, persuaded that such  an excursion would be productive of much amusement to both her  daughters, and perceiving through all her affectionate attention to  herself, how much the heart of Marianne was in it, would not hear of  their declining the offer upon HER account; insisted on their both  accepting it directly; and then began to foresee, with her usual  cheerfulness, a variety of advantages that would accrue to them all,  from this separation.    "I am delighted with the plan," she cried, "it is exactly what I could  wish.  Margaret and I shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves.  When you and the Middletons are gone, we shall go on so quietly and  happily together with our books and our music! You will find Margaret  so improved when you come back again!  I have a little plan of  alteration for your bedrooms too, which may now be performed without  any inconvenience to any one.  It is very right that you SHOULD go to  town; I would have every young woman of your condition in life  acquainted with the manners and amusements of London.  You will be  under the care of a motherly good sort of woman, of whose kindness to  you I can have no doubt.  And in all probability you will see your  brother, and whatever may be his faults, or the faults of his wife,  when I consider whose son he is, I cannot bear to have you so wholly  estranged from each other."

The next morning brought Elinor a letter by the two-penny post from  Lucy herself.  It was as follows:                        "Bartlett's Building, March.         "I hope my dear Miss Dashwood will excuse the       liberty I take of writing to her; but I know your       friendship for me will make you pleased to hear such       a good account of myself and my dear Edward, after       all the troubles we have went through lately,       therefore will make no more apologies, but proceed       to say that, thank God! though we have suffered       dreadfully, we are both quite well now, and as happy       as we must always be in one another's love.

This delay on the Colonel's side, however, did not seem to offend or  mortify his fair companion in the least, for on their breaking up the  conference soon afterwards, and moving different ways, Mrs. Jennings  very plainly heard Elinor say, and with a voice which shewed her to  feel what she said,    "I shall always think myself very much obliged to you."    Mrs. Jennings was delighted with her gratitude, and only wondered that  after hearing such a sentence, the Colonel should be able to take leave  of them, as he immediately did, with the utmost sang-froid, and go away  without making her any reply!--She had not thought her old friend could  have made so indifferent a suitor.    What had really passed between them was to this effect.    "I have heard," said he, with great compassion, "of the injustice your  friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered from his family; for if I understand  the matter right, he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering  in his engagement with a very deserving young woman.-- Have I been  rightly informed?--Is it so?--"    Elinor told him that it was.    "The cruelty, the impolitic cruelty,"--he replied, with great  feeling,--"of dividing, or attempting to divide, two young people long  attached to each other, is terrible.-- Mrs. Ferrars does not know what  she may be doing--what she may drive her son to.

She thanked him for it with all her heart, spoke of  Edward's principles and disposition with that praise which she knew  them to deserve; and promised to undertake the commission with  pleasure, if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office  to another.  But at the same time, she could not help thinking that no  one could so well perform it as himself.  It was an office in short,  from which, unwilling to give Edward the pain of receiving an  obligation from HER, she would have been very glad to be spared  herself;-- but Colonel Brandon, on motives of equal delicacy, declining  it likewise, still seemed so desirous of its being given through her  means, that she would not on any account make farther opposition.

The little she said was  all in lamentation of this inevitable delay; though Elinor tried to  raise her spirits, and make her believe, as she THEN really believed  herself, that it would be a very short one.    The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the  patient; she certainly was not better, and, except that there was no  amendment, did not appear worse.  Their party was now farther reduced;  for Mr. Palmer, though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity  and good-nature, as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away  by his wife, was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his  promise of following her; and while he was preparing to go, Colonel  Brandon himself, with a much greater exertion, began to talk of going  likewise.--Here, however, the kindness of Mrs.

To know that Marianne was in town  was--in the same language--a thunderbolt.--Thunderbolts and  daggers!--what a reproof would she have given me!--her taste, her  opinions--I believe they are better known to me than my own,--and I am  sure they are dearer."    Elinor's heart, which had undergone many changes in the course of this  extraordinary conversation, was now softened again;--yet she felt it  her duty to check such ideas in her companion as the last.    "This is not right, Mr. Willoughby.--Remember that you are married.  Relate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to hear."

Elinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street, of his  opinion of what his own mediation in his brother's affairs might have  done, if applied to in time.  She repeated it to Edward.    "THAT was exactly like Robert,"--was his immediate observation.--"And  THAT," he presently added, "might perhaps be in HIS head when the  acquaintance between them first began.  And Lucy perhaps at first might  think only of procuring his good offices in my favour.  Other designs  might afterward arise."    How long it had been carrying on between them, however, he was equally  at a loss with herself to make out; for at Oxford, where he had  remained for choice ever since his quitting London, he had had no means  of hearing of her but from herself, and her letters to the very last  were neither less frequent, nor less affectionate than usual.  Not the  smallest suspicion, therefore, had ever occurred to prepare him for  what followed;--and when at last it burst on him in a letter from Lucy  herself, he had been for some time, he believed, half stupified between  the wonder, the horror, and the joy of such a deliverance.  He put the  letter into Elinor's hands.

Who that cares much to know the history of man,  and how the mysterious mixture behaves under the  varying experiments of Time, has not dwelled, at  least briefly, on the life of Saint Theresa, has not  smiled with some gentleness at the thought of the  little girl walking forth one morning hand in hand  with her still smaller brother, to go and seek  martyrdom in the country of the Moors ? Out they  toddled from rugged Avila, wide eyed and helpless  looking as two fawns, but with human hearts,  already beating to a national idea ; until domestic  reality met them in the shape of uncles, and turned  them back from their great resolve. That child  pilgrimage was a fit beginning. Theresa's passionate,  ideal nature demanded an epic life : what were  many volumed romances of chivalry and the social  conquests of a brilliant girl to her? Her flame  quickly burned up that light fuel ; and, fed from  within, soared after some illimitable satisfaction,  some object which would never justify weariness,  which would reconcile self despair with the rapturous  consciousness of life beyond self. She found  her epos in the reform of a religious order.    That Spanish woman who lived three hundred  years ago, was certainly not the last of her kind.  Many Theresas have been born who found for  themselves no epic life wherein there was a con      2 MIDDLEMARCH.

With dim lights and tangled circumstance  they tried to shape their thought and deed in noble  agreement ; but after all, to common eyes their  struggles seemed mere inconsistency and formlessness  ; for these later born Theresas were helped by  no coherent social faith and order which could  perform the function of knowledge for the ardently  willing soul. Their ardour alternated between a  vague ideal and the common yearning of womanhood  ; so that the one was disapproved as extravagance,  and the other condemned as a lapse.    Some have felt that these blundering lives are  due to the inconvenient indefiniteness with which  the Supreme Power has fashioned the natures of  women : if there were one level of feminine incompetence  as strict as the ability to count three and  no more, the social lot of women might be treated  with scientific certitude. Meanwhile the indefiniteness  remains, and the limits of variation are  really much wider than any one would imagine  from the sameness of women's coiffure and the  favourite love stories in prose and verse. Here  and there a cygnet is reared uneasily among the  ducklings in the brown pond, and never finds the  living stream in fellowship with its own oary  footed kind. Here and there is born a Saint  Theresa, foundress of nothing, whose loving heartbeats  and sobs after an unattained goodness tremble  off and are dispersed among hindrances, instead of  centring in some long recognisable deed.

But on this side too there  was a cheering sense of money ; for Mrs. Vincy's  sister had been second wife to rich old Mr. Feath  erstone, and had died childless years ago, so that  her nephews and nieces might be supposed to touch  the affections of the widower. And it happened  that Mr. Bulstrode and Mr. Featherstone, two of  Peacock's most important patients, had, from different  causes, given an especially good reception to  his successor, who had raised some partisanship as  well as discussion. Mr. Wrench, medical attendant  to the Vincy family, very early had grounds  for thinking lightly of Lydgate's professional discretion,  and there was no report about him which  was not retailed at the Vincys', where visitors  were frequent. Mr. Vincy was more inclined to  general good fellowship than to taking sides, but  there was no need for him to be hasty in making  any new man's acquaintance.

To share lodgings with a brilliant  dinner companion, or to see your favourite politician  in the Ministry, may bring about changes quite as  rapid : in these cases too we begin by knowing  little and believing much, and we sometimes end by  inverting the quantities.    Still, such comparisons might mislead, for no man  was more incapable of flashy make believe than Mr.  Casaubon: he was as genuine a character as any  ruminant animal, and he had not actively assisted  in creating any illusions about himself. How was  it that in the weeks since her marriage, Dorothea  had not distinctly observed but felt with a stifling  depression, that the large vistas and wide fresh air  which she had dreamed of finding in her husband's  mind were replaced by anterooms and winding passages  which seemed to lead nowhither ? I suppose it  was that in courtship everything is regarded as provisional  and preliminary, and the smallest sample of  virtue or accomplishment is taken to guarantee  delightful stores which the broad leisure of marriage  will reveal. But, the door sill of marriage once  crossed, expectation is concentrated on the present.  Having once embarked on your marital voyage, it is  impossible not to be aware that you make no way  and that the sea is not within sight, — that, in fact,  you are exploring an enclosed basin.

" But Sir Walter Scott, — I suppose Mr. Lydgate  knows him, " said young Plymdale, a little cheered  by this advantage.    " Oh, I read no literature now, " said Lydgate,  shutting the book, and pushing it away. " I read  so much when I was a lad that I suppose it will  last me all my life. I used to know Scott's poems  by heart. "    " I should like to know when you left off, " said  Eosamond, " because then I might be sure that I  knew something which you did not know.

In this v^'ay it came to his  knowledge that Mr. Garth had carried the man to  Stone Court in his gig ; and Mr. Hawley in consequence  took an opportunity of seeing Caleb, calling  at his office to ask whether he had time to undertake  an arbitration if it were re({uired, and then  asking him incidentally al)Out Raffles. Caleb was  betrayed mto no word injurious to Bulstrode beyond  the fact which he was forced to admit, that  he had given up acting for him within the last  week. Mr. Hawley drew his inferences, and feeling  convinced that Rallies had told his story to Garth,  and that Garth had given up Bulstrode's ali'airs in  consequence, said so a few hours later to Mr. Toller.

While  Lydgate was reading the letter to Eosamond, her  face looked like a reviving flower, — it grew prettier  and more blooming. There was nothing unendurable  now : the debts were paid, Mr. Ladislaw was  coming, and Lydgate would be persuaded to leave  Middlemarch and settle in L<jndon, which was " so  different from a provincial town."    That was a bright bit of morning. But soon the  sky became black over poor Eosamond. The presence  of a new gluom in her husband, about which  he was entirely reserved towards her, — for he  dreaded to expose his lacerated feeling to her neutrality  and misconception, — soon received a painfully  strange explanation, alien to all her previous  notions of what could affect her happiness. In the  new gaiety of her spirits, thinking that Lydgate  had merely a worse fit of moodiness than usual,  causing him to leave her remarks unanswered, and  evidently to keep out of her way as much as possible,  she chose, a few days after the meeting, and  without speaking to him on the subject, to send out  notes of invitation for a small evening party, feeling  convinced that this was a judicious step, since  people seemed to have been keeping aloof from  them, and wanted restoring to the old habit of intercourse. 
ElioGM.txt	1385	13140000.0	1871	Eliot, George	Middlemarch	  Such being the bent of Celia's heart, it was inevitable  that Sir James should consent to a reconciliation  with Dorothea and her husband. Where  women love each other, men learn to smother their  mutual dislike. Sir James never liked Ladislaw,  and Will always preferred to have Sir James's company  mixed with another kind: they were on a      424 MIDDLEMARCH.    footing of reciprocal tolerance which was made  quite easy only when Dorothea and Celia were  present.    It became an understood thing that Mr. and Mrs.  Ladislaw should pay at least two visits during the  year to the Grange, and there came gradually a  small row of cousins at Freshitt who enjoyed  playing with the two cousins visiting Tipton as  much as if the blood of these cousins had been less  dubiously mixed.    Mr. Brook lived to a good old age, and his estate  was inherited by Dorothea's son, who might have  represented Middlemarch, but declined, thinking  that his opinions had less chance of being stifled  if he remained out of doors.    Sir James never ceased to regard Dorothea's  second marriage as" a mistake ; and indeed this  remained the tradition concerning it in Middle  march, where she was spoken of to a younger  generation as a fine girl who married a sickly  clergyman, old enough to be her father, and in  little more than a year after his death gave up her  estate to marry his cousin, — young enough to have  been his son, with no property, and not wellborn. 
ElioGM.txt	1386	26280000.0	1871	Eliot, George	Middlemarch	Those who had not seen anything of Dorothea  usually observed that she could not have been " a  nice woman, " else she would not have married  either the one or the other.    Certainly those determinmg acts of her life were  not ideally beautiful. They were the mixed result  of young and noble impulse struggling amidst the  conditions of an imperfect social state, in which  great feelings will often take the aspect of error,  and great faith the aspect of illusion. For there is  no creature whose inward being is so strong that it      SUNSET AND SUNRISE. 425    is not greatly determined by what lies outside it.  A new Theresa will hardly have the opportunity of  reforming a conventual life, any more than a new  Antigone will spend her heroic piety in daring all  for the sake of a brother's burial : the medium in  which their ardent deeds took shape is forever gone.  But we insignificant people with our daily words  and acts are preparing the lives of many Dorotheas,  some of which may present a far sadder sacrifice  than that of the Dorothea whose story we know.    Her finely touched spirit had still its fine issues,  though they were not widely visible. Her full  nature, like that river of which Cyrus broke the  strength, spent itself in channels which had no  great name on the earth. But the effect of her  being on those around her was incalculably diffusive  : for the growing good of the world is partly  dependent on unhistoric acts ; and that things are  not so ill with you and me as they might have been,  is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a  hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.    •THE END. 
BiggES.txt	0	0.33320000000000005	1913	Biggers, Earl Derr	Seven keys to Baldpate	CHAPTER I    "WEEP NO MORE, MY LADY"      A young woman was crying bitterly in the waiting-room of the railway  station at Upper Asquewan Falls, New York.    A beautiful young woman? That is exactly what Billy Magee wanted to know  as, closing the waiting-room door behind him, he stood staring just  inside. Were the features against which that frail bit of cambric was  agonizingly pressed of a pleasing contour? The girl's neatly tailored  corduroy suit and her flippant but charming millinery augured well.  Should he step gallantly forward and inquire in sympathetic tones as to  the cause of her woe? Should he carry chivalry even to the lengths of  Upper Asquewan Falls?    No, Mr. Magee decided he would not. The train that had just roared away  into the dusk had not brought him from the region of skyscrapers and  derby hats for deeds of knight errantry up state. Anyhow, the girl's  tears were none of his business. A railway station was a natural place  for grief--a field of many partings, upon whose floor fell often in  torrents the tears of those left behind. A friend, mayhap a lover, had  been whisked off into the night by the relentless five thirty-four  local. Why not a lover? Surely about such a dainty trim figure as this  courtiers hovered as moths about a flame. Upon a tender intimate sorrow  it was not the place of an unknown Magee to intrude. He put his hand  gently upon the latch of the door. 
BiggES.txt	1	1.8	1913	Biggers, Earl Derr	Seven keys to Baldpate	  And yet--dim and heartless and cold was the interior of that  waiting-room. No place, surely, for a gentleman to leave a lady  sorrowful, particularly when the lady was so alluring. Oh, beyond  question, she was most alluring. Mr. Magee stepped softly to the ticket  window and made low-voiced inquiry of the man inside.    "What's she crying about?" he asked.    A thin sallow face, on the forehead of which a mop of ginger-colored  hair lay listlessly, was pressed against the bars.    "Thanks," said the ticket agent. "I get asked the same old questions so  often, one like yours sort of breaks the monotony. Sorry I can't help  you. She's a woman, and the Lord only knows why women cry. And sometimes  I reckon even He must be a little puzzled. Now, my wife--"    "I think I'll ask her," confided Mr. Magee in a hoarse whisper.    "Oh, I wouldn't," advised the man behind the bars. "It's best to let 'em  alone. They stop quicker if they ain't noticed."    "But she's in trouble," argued Billy Magee.    "And so'll you be, most likely," responded the cynic, "if you interfere.  No, siree! Take my advice. Shoot old Asquewan's rapids in a barrel if  you want to, but keep away from crying women."    The heedless Billy Magee, however, was already moving across the  unscrubbed floor with chivalrous intention. 
BiggES.txt	4	1.5	1913	Biggers, Earl Derr	Seven keys to Baldpate	  "Certainly," replied Mr. Magee. He turned away. As he did so he collided  with a rather excessive lady. She gave the impression of solidity and  bulk; her mouth was hard and knowing. Mr. Magee felt that she wanted to  vote, and that she would say as much from time to time. The lady had a  glittering eye; she put it to its time-honored use and fixed Mr. Magee  with it.    "I was crying, mamma," the girl explained, "and this gentleman inquired  if he could be of any service."    Mamma! Mr. Magee wanted to add his tears to those of the girl. This  frail and lovely damsel in distress owning as her maternal parent a  heavy unnecessary--person! The older woman also had yellow hair, but it  was the sort that suggests the white enamel pallor of a drug store, with  the soda-fountain fizzing and the bottles of perfume ranged in an  odorous row. Mamma! Thus rolled the world along.    "Well, they ain't no use gettin' all worked up for nothing," advised the  unpleasant parent. Mr. Magee was surprised that in her tone there was no  hostility to him--thus belying her looks. "Mebbe the gentleman can  direct us to a good hotel," she added, with a rather stagy smile.    "I'm a stranger here, too," Mr. Magee replied. "I'll interview the man  over there in the cage."    The gentleman referred to was not cheerful in his replies. There was, he  said, Baldpate Inn. 
BiggES.txt	27	3.0	1913	Biggers, Earl Derr	Seven keys to Baldpate	  He mounted the stairs. After him followed the youth of flashy  habiliments, looking fearfully about him as he went. He seemed surprised  that they came to Magee's room without incident. Inside, Mr. Magee drew  up an easy chair before the fire, and offered his guest a cigar.    "You must be cold," he said. "Sit here. 'A bad night, stranger' as they  remark in stories."    "You've said it," replied the young man, accepting the cigar. "Thanks."  He walked to the door leading into the hall and opened it about a foot.  "I'm afraid," he explained jocosely, "we'll get to talking, and miss the  breakfast bell." He dropped into the chair, and lighted his cigar at a  candle end. "Say, you never can tell, can you? Climbing up old Baldpate  I thought to myself, that hotel certainly makes the Sahara Desert look  like a cozy corner. And here you are, as snug and comfortable and at  home as if you were in a Harlem flat. You never can tell. And what now?  The story of my life?"    "You might relate," Mr. Magee told him, "that portion of it that has led  you trespassing on a gentleman seeking seclusion at Baldpate Inn."    The stranger looked at Mr. Magee. He had an eye that not only looked,  but weighed, estimated, and classified. Mr. Magee met it smilingly.    "Trespassing, eh?" said the young man. "Far be it from me to quarrel  with a man who smokes as good cigars as you do--but there's something I  haven't quite doped out. That is--who's trespassing, me or you?" 
BiggES.txt	52	2.2	1913	Biggers, Earl Derr	Seven keys to Baldpate	  "You're dead wrong. I'm no villager. My instincts are all in the other  direction--away from the crowd. I live up near the top of Baldpate, in a  little shack I built myself. My name's Peters--Jake Peters--in the  winter. But in the summer, when the inn's open, and the red and white  awnings are out, and the band plays in the casino every night--then I'm  the Hermit of Baldpate Mountain. I come down here and sell picture  post-cards of myself to the ladies."    Mr. Magee appeared overcome with mirth.    "A professional hermit, by the gods!" he cried. "Say, I didn't know  Baldpate Mountain was fitted up with all the modern improvements. This  is great luck. I'm an amateur at the hermit business, you'll have to  teach me the fine points. Sit down."    "Just between ourselves, I'm not a regular hermit," said the plump  bewhiskered one, sitting gingerly on the edge of a frail chair. "Not one  of these 'all for love of a woman' hermits you read about in books. Of  course, I have to pretend I am, in summer, in order to sell the cards  and do my whole duty by the inn management. A lot of the women ask me in  soft tones about the great disappointment that drove me to old Baldpate,  and I give 'em various answers, according to how I feel. Speaking to you  as a friend, and considering the fact that it's the dead of winter, I  may say there was little or no romance in my life. I married early, and  stayed married a long time. I came up here for peace and quiet, and  because I felt a man ought to read something besides time-tables and  tradesmen's bills, and have something over his head besides a first and  second mortgage." 
BiggES.txt	79	3.5	1913	Biggers, Earl Derr	Seven keys to Baldpate	  They went together to the kitchen, found a pail, and filled it with icy  water from the pump at the rear of the inn. Inside once more, Mr. Magee  remarked thoughtfully:    "Who would have guessed a week ago that to-day I would be climbing the  broad staircase of a summer hotel carrying a pail of water for a lady  fair?"    They paused on the landing.    "There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio," smiled the girl,  "than are dreamed of, even by novelists." Mr. Magee started. Had she  recognized him as the Magee of light fiction? It seemed hardly likely;  they read his books, but they rarely remembered his name. Her face went  suddenly grave. She came closer. "I can't help wondering," she said,  "which side you are on?"    "Which side of what?" asked Magee.    "Why, of this," she answered, waving her hand toward the office below.    "I don't understand," objected Mr. Magee.    "Let's not be silly," she replied. "You know what brought me here. I  know what brought you. There are three sides, and only one is honest. I  hope, so very much, that you are on that side."    "Upon my word--" began Magee.    "Will it interest you to know," she continued, "I saw the big mayor of  Reuton in the village this morning? With him was his shadow, Lou Max.  Let's see--you had the first key, Mr. Bland the second, the professor  the third, and I had the fourth. The mayor has the fifth key, of course. 
BiggES.txt	114	2.0	1913	Biggers, Earl Derr	Seven keys to Baldpate	  "The ready money, the loosened kale, the posies in the garden waiting to  be plucked," elucidated Mr. Max. "This guy, Sam says, was such a perfect  rube he just naturally looked past him to see if there was a trail of  wisps of hay on the floor. For a while Sam sits there with a grouch as  he thought how hard it was to put business aside and get a little rest  now and then, and debating whether, being on a vacation, as it was, he'd  exert himself enough to stretch forth his hand and take whatever money  the guy had. While he was arguing the matter with himself, the jay  settled the question by coming over and sitting down near him.    "He's in the city, he tells Sam, to enjoy the moving pictures of the  streets, and otherwise forget the trees back home that grow the cherries  in the bottom of the cocktail glasses. 'And believe me,' he says to Sam,  'there ain't none of those confidence men going to get me. I'm too  wise,' he says.    "'I'll bet money you are,' Sam tells him laughing all over at the fish  that was fighting to get into the net.    "'Yes, siree,' says the last of the Mohicans, 'they can't fool me. I can  tell them as fur away as I can see 'em, and my eyesight's perfect. One  of 'em comes up to me in City Hall park and tries to sell me some mining  stock. I guess he ain't recovered yet from what I said to him. I tell  you, they can't fool Mark Dennen,' says the guy. 
BiggES.txt	121	1.9	1913	Biggers, Earl Derr	Seven keys to Baldpate	  "Who?" asked Mr. Magee.    "I don't know--a tall black figure--hiding outside a window like myself.  The man with one of the other keys, I suppose. The man Mr. Bland heard  walking about to-night. I saw him and I was terribly frightened. It's  all right when you know who the other fellow is, but when--it's all so  creepy--I was afraid. So I ran--here."    "The thing to do," approved Mr. Magee. "Don't worry. I'll get the money  for you. I'll get it if I have to slay the city administration of Reuton  in its tracks."    "You trust me?" asked the girl, with a little catch in her voice. The  snow lay white on her hair; even in the shadows her eyes suggested June  skies. "Without knowing who I am, or why I must have this money--you'll  get it for me?"    "Some people," said Mr. Magee, "meet all their lives long at pink little  teas, and never know one another, while others just smile at each other  across a station waiting-room--that's enough."    "I'm so glad," whispered the girl. "I never dreamed I'd meet any one  like you--up here. Please, oh, please, be very careful. Neither Cargan  nor Max is armed. Bland is. I should never forgive myself if you were  hurt. But you won't be--will you?" 
BiggES.txt	180	1.9	1913	Biggers, Earl Derr	Seven keys to Baldpate	  Miss Norton turned away from the fire, and Mr. Magee rose hastily to  follow. He stood close behind her, gazing down at her golden hair  shimmering in the dark.    "I've just been thinking," he said lightly, "what an absolutely  ridiculous figure I must be in your eyes, buzzing round and round like a  bee in a bottle, and getting nowhere at all. Listen--no one has left the  inn. While they stay, there's hope. Am I not to have one more chance--a  chance to prove to you how much I care?"    She turned, and even in the dusk he saw that her eyes were wet.    "Oh, I don't know, I don't know," she whispered. "I'm not angry any  more. I'm just--at sea. I don't know what to think--what to do. Why try  any longer? I think I'll go away--and give up."    "You mustn't do that," urged Magee. They came back into the firelight.  "Miss Thornhill has just informed me that she knows who has the  package!"    "Indeed," said the girl calmly, but her face had flushed.    "I didn't let her tell me, of course."    "Why not?" Oh, how maddening women could be!    "Why not?" Magee's tone was hurt. "Because I couldn't use her  information in getting the money for you."    "You are still 'going to' get the money for me?"    Maddening certainly, as a rough-edged collar. 
BiggES.txt	196	2.5	1913	Biggers, Earl Derr	Seven keys to Baldpate	  "Mr. Magee," replied the much wrapped gentleman, "I am that rather  disturbing progressive--a fresh air devotee. I feel that God's good air  was meant to be breathed, not barricaded from our bodies."    "Perhaps," suggested Magee, "I should have left the window open?"    The old man regarded him narrowly.    "I have no wish to be inhospitable," he replied. "But--if you please--"    "Certainly," answered Magee. He threw open the window. The professor  held up his book.    "I was passing the time before dinner with my pleasant old companion,  Montaigne. Mr. Magee, have you ever read his essay on liars?"    "Never," said Magee. "But I do not blame you for brushing up on it at  the present time, Professor. I have come to apologize. Yesterday morning  I referred in a rather unpleasant way to a murder in the chemical  laboratory at one of our universities. I said that the professor of  chemistry was missing. This morning's paper, which I secured from Mr.  Peters, informs me that he has been apprehended."    "You need not have troubled to tell me," said the old man. He smiled his  bleak smile.    "I did you an injustice," went on Magee.    "Let us say no more of it," pleaded Professor Bolton.    Mr. Magee walked about the room. Warily the professor turned so that the  other was at no instant at his back. He looked so helpless, so little,  so ineffectual, that Mr. Magee abandoned his first plan of leaping upon  him there in the silence. By more subtle means than this must his  purpose be attained. 
BiggES.txt	210	2.0	1913	Biggers, Earl Derr	Seven keys to Baldpate	  "Mr. Hayden," remarked Magee, "are we to hear from you?"    Hayden hesitated, and looked for a moment into the black eyes of Myra  Thornhill.    "My idea has often been contradicted," he said, keeping his gaze on the  girl, "it may be again. But to me the greatest romance in the world is  the romance of money making--dollar piling on dollar in the vaults of  the man who started with a shoe-string, and hope, and nerve. I see him  fighting for the first thousand--and then I see his pile growing, slowly  at first--faster--faster--faster--until a motor-car brings him to his  office, and men speak his name with awe in the streets."    "Money," commented Miss Thornhill contemptuously. "What an idea of  romance for a man."    "I did not expect," replied Hayden, "that my definition would pass  unchallenged. My past experiences--" he looked meaningly at the  girl--"had led me to be prepared for that. But it is my definition--I  spoke the truth. You must give me credit for that."    "I ain't one to blame you," sneered Cargan, "for wanting it noticed when  you do side-step a lie. Yes, I certainly--"    "See here, Cargan," blazed Hayden.    "Yes, you did speak the truth," put in Miss Thornhill hastily. "You  mentioned one word in your definition--it was a desecration to drag it  in--hope. For me romance means only--hope. And I'm afraid there are a  pitiful number in the world to whom it means the same." 
BiggES.txt	237	2.0	1913	Biggers, Earl Derr	Seven keys to Baldpate	  "I found a half-inch of open space," explained the old man. "Yes, I  actually lay on my stomach in the snow and watched you. In the morning,  for the first time in my life, I committed robbery. My punishment was  swift and sure. Bland swooped down upon me. Again this afternoon, I came  upon the precious package, after a long search, in the hands of the  Hermit of Baldpate. I thought we were safe at last when I handed the  package to Kendrick in my room to-night--but I had not counted on the  wild things a youth like you will do for love of a designing maid."    Twelve o'clock! The civic center of Upper Asquewan Falls proclaimed it.  Mr. Magee had never been in Reuton. He was sorry he hadn't. He had to  construct from imagination alone the great Reuton station through which  the girl and the money must now be hurrying--where? The question would  not down. Was she--as the professor believed--designing?    "No," said Mr. Magee, answering aloud his own question. "You are wrong,  sir. I do not know just what the motives of Miss Norton were in desiring  this money, but I will stake my reputation as an honest hold-up man that  they were perfectly all right."    "Perhaps," replied the other, quite unconvinced. "But--what honest  motive could she have? I am able to assign her no rôle in this little  drama. I have tried. I am able to see no connection between her and the  other characters. What--" 
BiggES.txt	239	2.1	1913	Biggers, Earl Derr	Seven keys to Baldpate	  "Yes," answered Professor Bolton. "In one of his letters long ago Hayden  told Kendrick he was engaged to the girl. It was the last letter  Kendrick received from him."    There was a pause.    "The important point now," the old man went on, "is the identity of this  girl to whom you have made your princely gift, out of the goodness of  your young heart. I propose to speak to the woman she has introduced as  her mother, and elicit what information I can."    He crossed the floor, followed by Mr. Magee, and stood by the woman's  chair. She looked up, her eyes heavy with sleep, her appearance more  tawdry than ever in that faint light.    "Madam," remarked the professor, with the air of a judge trying a case,  "your daughter has to-night made her escape from this place with a large  sum of money earnestly desired by the prosecuting attorney of Reuton  county. In the name of the law, I command you to tell me her  destination, and what she proposes to do with that package of  greenbacks."    The woman blinked stupidly in the dusk.    "She ain't my daughter," she replied, and Mr. Magee's heart leaped up.  "I can tell you that much. I keep a boarding-house in Reuton and  Miss--the girl you speak about--has been my boarder for three years. She  brought me up here as a sort of chaperon, though I don't see as I'm old  enough for that yet. You don't get nothing else out of me--except that  she is a perfectly lovely young woman, and your money couldn't be safer  with the president of the United States." 
BiggES.txt	263	2.0	1913	Biggers, Earl Derr	Seven keys to Baldpate	  "Got shaky in the knees," said Cargan. "Afraid of the reformers. Ain't  had much experience in these things, or he'd know he might just as well  tremble at the approach of a blue-bottle fly. We put him on a train  going the other direction from Reuton early this morning. He thinks he'd  better seek his fortune elsewhere." He leaned in heavy confidence toward  Magee. "Say, young fellow," he whispered, "put me wise. That little  sleight of hand game you worked last night had me dizzy. Where's the  coin? Where's the girl? What's the game? Take the boodle and welcome--it  ain't mine--but put me next to what's doing, so I'll know how my  instalment of this serial story ought to read."    "Mr. Cargan," replied Magee, "you know as much about that girl as I do.  She asked me to get her the money, and I did."    "But what's your place in the game?"    "A looker-on in Athens," returned Magee. "Translated, a guy who had  bumped into a cyclone and was sitting tight waiting for it to blow over.  I--I took a fancy to her, as you might put it. She wanted the money. I  got it for her."    "A pretty fairy story, my boy," the mayor commented.    "Absolutely true," smiled Magee.    "What do you think of that for an explanation, Lou," inquired Cargan,  "she asked him for the money and he gave it to her?"    Mr. Max leered. 
BiggES.txt	295	1.0	1913	Biggers, Earl Derr	Seven keys to Baldpate	  And, on an easel, the sad portrait of a gentleman, undoubtedly the late  lamented Norton. His uninteresting nose appeared to turn up at the  constant odor of cookery in which it dwelt; his hair was plastered down  over his forehead in a gorgeous abandoned curve such as some of the  least sophisticated of Mr. John T. McCutcheon's gentlemen affect.    Mr. Magee stared round the room and smiled. Was the romance of reality  never to resemble the romance of his dreams? Where were the dim lights,  where the distant waltz, where the magic of moonlight amid which he was  some day to have told a beautiful girl of his love? Hardly in Mrs.  Norton's parlor.    She came and stood in the doorway. Hatless, coatless, smiling, she  flooded the place with her beauty. Mr. Magee looked at the flabby angels  on the wall, expecting them to hide their faces in shame. But no, they  still rode brazenly their unstable clouds.    "Come in," he cried. "Don't leave me alone here again, please. And tell  me--is this the gentleman who took the contract for making Mrs. Norton  happy?"    "I--I can't come in," she said, blushing. She seemed to wish to avoid  him. "Yes, that is Mr. Norton." She came nearer the easel, and smiled at  the late lamented's tonsorial crown. "I must leave you--just a moment--"    Billy Magee's heart beat wildly. His breath came fast. He seized her by  the hand. 
BiggES.txt	296	2.0	1913	Biggers, Earl Derr	Seven keys to Baldpate	  "You're never going to leave me again," he cried. "Don't you know that?  I thought you knew. You're mine. I love you. I love you. It's all I can  say, my dearest. Look at me--look at me, please."    "It has happened so quickly," she murmured. "Things can't be true when  they--happen so quickly."    "A woman's logic," said Mr. Magee. "It has happened. My beautiful girl.  Look at me."    And then--she looked. Trembling, flushed, half frightened, half  exultant, she lifted her eyes to his.    "My little girl!" he cried down at her.    A moment longer she held off, and then limply she surrendered. And Billy  Magee held her close in his arms.    "Take care of me," she whispered. "I--I love you so." Her arm went  timidly about his shoulders. "Do you want to know my name? It's Mary--"    Mary what? The answer was seemingly of no importance, for Mr. Magee's  lips were on hers, crushing the word at its birth.    So they stood, amid Mrs. Norton's gloomy objects of art. And presently  she asked:    "How about the book, dear?"    But Mr. Magee had forgot.    "What book?" he asked.    "The novel you went to Baldpate to write Don't you remember, dearest--no  melodrama, no wild chase, no--love?"    "Why--" Mr. Magee paused for a moment in the joy of his discovery. Then  he came back to the greater joy in his arms.    "Why, darling," he explained gently, "this is it."      THE END

His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a glass: he had a hairy face.    He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.    O, the wild rose blossoms    On the little green place.        He sang that song. That was his song.    O, the green wothe botheth.        When you wet the bed first it is warm then it gets cold. His mother put on the oilsheet. That had the queer smell.    His mother had a nicer smell than his father. She played on the piano the sailor's hornpipe for him to dance. He danced:    Tralala lala,    Tralala tralaladdy,    Tralala lala,    Tralala lala.        Uncle Charles and Dante clapped. They were older than his father and mother but uncle Charles was older than Dante.

The brush with the maroon velvet back was for Michael Davitt and the brush with the green velvet back was for Parnell. Dante gave him a cachou every time he brought her a piece of tissue paper.    The Vances lived in number seven. They had a different father and mother. They were Eileen's father and mother. When they were grown up he was going to marry Eileen. He hid under the table. His mother said:    —O, Stephen will apologize.    Dante said:    —O, if not, the eagles will come and pull out his eyes.—    Pull out his eyes,    Apologize,    Apologize,    Pull out his eyes.    Apologize,    Pull out his eyes,    Pull out his eyes,    Apologize.            * * *            The wide playgrounds were swarming with boys. All were shouting and the prefects urged them on with strong cries. The evening air was pale and chilly and after every charge and thud of the footballers the greasy leather orb flew like a heavy bird through the grey light. He kept on the fringe of his line, out of sight of his prefect, out of the reach of the rude feet, feigning to run now and then. He felt his body small and weak amid the throng of the players and his eyes were weak and watery. Rody Kickham was not like that: he would be captain of the third line all the fellows said. 
JoycJA.txt	59	2.0	1916	Joyce, James	A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man	  Fleming knelt down, squeezing his hands under his armpits, his face contorted with pain; but Stephen knew how hard his hands were because Fleming was always rubbing rosin into them. But perhaps he was in great pain for the noise of the pandybat was terrible. Stephen's heart was beating and fluttering.    —At your work, all of you! shouted the prefect of studies. We want no lazy idle loafers here, lazy idle little schemers. At your work, I tell you. Father Dolan will be in to see you every day. Father Dolan will be in tomorrow.    He poked one of the boys in the side with his pandybat, saying:    —You, boy! When will Father Dolan be in again?    —Tomorrow, sir, said Tom Furlong's voice.    —Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, said the prefect of studies. Make up your minds for that. Every day Father Dolan. Write away. You, boy, who are you?    Stephen's heart jumped suddenly.    —Dedalus, sir.    —Why are you not writing like the others?    —I...my...    He could not speak with fright.    —Why is he not writing, Father Arnall?    —He broke his glasses, said Father Arnall, and I exempted him from work.    —Broke? What is this I hear? What is this your name is! said the prefect of studies.    —Dedalus, sir.    —Out here, Dedalus. Lazy little schemer. I see schemer in your face. Where did you break your glasses? 
JoycJA.txt	64	15.0	1916	Joyce, James	A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man	  —Yes, said Cecil Thunder eagerly, and I saw him lift the pandy-bat over his shoulder and he's not allowed to do that.    —Did they hurt you much? Nasty Roche asked.    —Very much, Stephen said.    —I wouldn't stand it, Fleming repeated, from Baldyhead or any other Baldyhead. It's a stinking mean low trick, that's what it is. I'd go straight up to the rector and tell him about it after dinner.    —Yes, do. Yes, do, said Cecil Thunder.    —Yes, do. Yes, go up and tell the rector on him, Dedalus, said Nasty Roche, because he said that he'd come in tomorrow again and pandy you.    —Yes, yes. Tell the rector, all said.    And there were some fellows out of second of grammar listening and one of them said:    —The senate and the Roman people declared that Dedalus had been wrongly punished.    It was wrong; it was unfair and cruel; and, as he sat in the refectory, he suffered time after time in memory the same humiliation until he began to wonder whether it might not really be that there was something in his face which made him look like a schemer and he wished he had a little mirror to see. But there could not be; and it was unjust and cruel and unfair. 
JoycJA.txt	80	40320.0	1916	Joyce, James	A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man	He thought it should be a pleasant life enough, driving along the roads every evening to deliver milk, if he had warm gloves and a fat bag of gingernuts in his pocket to eat from. But the same foreknowledge which had sickened his heart and made his legs sag suddenly as he raced round the park, the same intuition which had made him glance with mistrust at his trainer's flabby stubble-covered face as it bent heavily over his long stained fingers, dissipated any vision of the future. In a vague way he understood that his father was in trouble and that this was the reason why he himself had not been sent back to Clongowes. For some time he had felt the slight change in his house; and those changes in what he had deemed unchangeable were so many slight shocks to his boyish conception of the world. The ambition which he felt astir at times in the darkness of his soul sought no outlet. A dusk like that of the outer world obscured his mind as he heard the mare's hoofs clattering along the tramtrack on the Rock Road and the great can swaying and rattling behind him. 
JoycJA.txt	109	150.0	1916	Joyce, James	A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man	  A few moments after he found himself on the stage amid the garish gas and the dim scenery, acting before the innumerable faces of the void. It surprised him to see that the play which he had known at rehearsals for a disjointed lifeless thing had suddenly assumed a life of its own. It seemed now to play itself, he and his fellow actors aiding it with their parts. When the curtain fell on the last scene he heard the void filled with applause and, through a rift in a side scene, saw the simple body before which he had acted magically deformed, the void of faces breaking at all points and falling asunder into busy groups.    He left the stage quickly and rid himself of his mummery and passed out through the chapel into the college garden. Now that the play was over his nerves cried for some further adventure. He hurried onwards as if to overtake it. The doors of the theatre were all open and the audience had emptied out. On the lines which he had fancied the moorings of an ark a few lanterns swung in the night breeze, flickering cheerlessly. He mounted the steps from the garden in haste, eager that some prey should not elude him, and forced his way through the crowd in the hall and past the two jesuits who stood watching the exodus and bowing and shaking hands with the visitors. He pushed onward nervously, feigning a still greater haste and faintly conscious of the smiles and stares and nudges which his powdered head left in its wake. 
JoycJA.txt	163	0	1916	Joyce, James	A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man	Every sense of the flesh is tortured and every faculty of the soul therewith: the eyes with impenetrable utter darkness, the nose with noisome odours, the ears with yells and howls and execrations, the taste with foul matter, leprous corruption, nameless suffocating filth, the touch with redhot goads and spikes, with cruel tongues of flame. And through the several torments of the senses the immortal soul is tortured eternally in its very essence amid the leagues upon leagues of glowing fires kindled in the abyss by the offended majesty of the Omnipotent God and fanned into everlasting and ever-increasing fury by the breath of the anger of the God-head.    —Consider finally that the torment of this infernal prison is increased by the company of the damned themselves. Evil company on earth is so noxious that the plants, as if by instinct, withdraw from the company of whatsoever is deadly or hurtful to them. In hell all laws are overturned—there is no thought of family or country, of ties, of relationships. The damned howl and scream at one another, their torture and rage intensified by the presence of beings tortured and raging like themselves. All sense of humanity is forgotten. The yells of the suffering sinners fill the remotest corners of the vast abyss. The mouths of the damned are full of blasphemies against God and of hatred for their fellow sufferers and of curses against those souls which were their accomplices in sin.
JoycJA.txt	206	80640.0	1916	Joyce, James	A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man	Images of the outbursts of trivial anger which he had often noted among his masters, their twitching mouths, close-shut lips and flushed cheeks, recurred to his memory, discouraging him, for all his practice of humility, by the comparison. To merge his life in the common tide of other lives was harder for him than any fasting or prayer and it was his constant failure to do this to his own satisfaction which caused in his soul at last a sensation of spiritual dryness together with a growth of doubts and scruples. His soul traversed a period of desolation in which the sacraments themselves seemed to have turned into dried-up sources. His confession became a channel for the escape of scrupulous and unrepented imperfections. His actual reception of the eucharist did not bring him the same dissolving moments of virginal self-surrender as did those spiritual communions made by him sometimes at the close of some visit to the Blessed Sacrament. The book which he used for these visits was an old neglected book written by saint Alphonsus Liguori, with fading characters and sere foxpapered leaves. A faded world of fervent love and virginal responses seemed to be evoked for his soul by the reading of its pages in which the imagery of the canticles was interwoven with the communicant's prayers. An inaudible voice seemed to caress the soul, telling her names and glories, bidding her arise as for espousal and come away, bidding her look forth, a spouse, from Amana and from the mountains of the leopards; and the soul seemed to answer with the same inaudible voice, surrendering herself: INTER UBERA MEA COMMORABITUR. 
JoycJA.txt	215	1576800.0	1916	Joyce, James	A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man	  To receive that call, Stephen, said the priest, is the greatest honour that the Almighty God can bestow upon a man. No king or emperor on this earth has the power of the priest of God. No angel or archangel in heaven, no saint, not even the Blessed Virgin herself, has the power of a priest of God: the power of the keys, the power to bind and to loose from sin, the power of exorcism, the power to cast out from the creatures of God the evil spirits that have power over them; the power, the authority, to make the great God of Heaven come down upon the altar and take the form of bread and wine. What an awful power, Stephen!    A flame began to flutter again on Stephen's cheek as he heard in this proud address an echo of his own proud musings. How often had he seen himself as a priest wielding calmly and humbly the awful power of which angels and saints stood in reverence! His soul had loved to muse in secret on this desire. He had seen himself, a young and silent-mannered priest, entering a confessional swiftly, ascending the altarsteps, incensing, genuflecting, accomplishing the vague acts of the priesthood which pleased him by reason of their semblance of reality and of their distance from it. In that dim life which he had lived through in his musings he had assumed the voices and gestures which he had noted with various priests.
JoycJA.txt	222	1.2	1916	Joyce, James	A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man	  He pushed open the latchless door of the porch and passed through the naked hallway into the kitchen. A group of his brothers and sisters was sitting round the table. Tea was nearly over and only the last of the second watered tea remained in the bottoms of the small glass jars and jampots which did service for teacups. Discarded crusts and lumps of sugared bread, turned brown by the tea which had been poured over them, lay scattered on the table. Little wells of tea lay here and there on the board, and a knife with a broken ivory handle was stuck through the pith of a ravaged turnover.    The sad quiet grey-blue glow of the dying day came through the window and the open door, covering over and allaying quietly a sudden instinct of remorse in Stephen's heart. All that had been denied them had been freely given to him, the eldest; but the quiet glow of evening showed him in their faces no sign of rancour.    He sat near them at the table and asked where his father and mother were. One answered:    —Goneboro toboro lookboro atboro aboro houseboro.    Still another removal! A boy named Fallon in Belvedere had often asked him with a silly laugh why they moved so often. A frown of scorn darkened quickly his forehead as he heard again the silly laugh of the questioner.    He asked:    —Why are we on the move again if it's a fair question?

So he had passed beyond the challenge of the sentries who had stood as guardians of his boyhood and had sought to keep him among them that he might be subject to them and serve their ends. Pride after satisfaction uplifted him like long slow waves. The end he had been born to serve yet did not see had led him to escape by an unseen path and now it beckoned to him once more and a new adventure was about to be opened to him. It seemed to him that he heard notes of fitful music leaping upwards a tone and downwards a diminished fourth, upwards a tone and downwards a major third, like triple-branching flames leaping fitfully, flame after flame, out of a midnight wood. It was an elfin prelude, endless and formless; and, as it grew wilder and faster, the flames leaping out of time, he seemed to hear from under the boughs and grasses wild creatures racing, their feet pattering like rain upon the leaves. Their feet passed in pattering tumult over his mind, the feet of hares and rabbits, the feet of harts and hinds and antelopes, until he heard them no more and remembered only a proud cadence from Newman:    —Whose feet are as the feet of harts and underneath the everlasting arms. 
JoycJA.txt	229	3.0	1916	Joyce, James	A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man	  Disheartened, he raised his eyes towards the slow-drifting clouds, dappled and seaborne. They were voyaging across the deserts of the sky, a host of nomads on the march, voyaging high over Ireland, westward bound. The Europe they had come from lay out there beyond the Irish Sea, Europe of strange tongues and valleyed and woodbegirt and citadelled and of entrenched and marshalled races. He heard a confused music within him as of memories and names which he was almost conscious of but could not capture even for an instant; then the music seemed to recede, to recede, to recede, and from each receding trail of nebulous music there fell always one longdrawn calling note, piercing like a star the dusk of silence. Again! Again! Again! A voice from beyond the world was calling.    —Hello, Stephanos!    —Here comes The Dedalus!    —Ao!... Eh, give it over, Dwyer, I'm telling you, or I'll give you a stuff in the kisser for yourself... Ao!    —Good man, Towser! Duck him!    —Come along, Dedalus! Bous Stephanoumenos! Bous Stephaneforos!    —Duck him! Guzzle him now, Towser!    —Help! Help!... Ao!    He recognized their speech collectively before he distinguished their faces. The mere sight of that medley of wet nakedness chilled him to the bone. Their bodies, corpse-white or suffused with a pallid golden light or rawly tanned by the sun, gleamed with the wet of the sea. Their diving-stone, poised on its rude supports and rocking under their plunges, and the rough-hewn stones of the sloping breakwater over which they scrambled in their horseplay gleamed with cold wet lustre. The towels with which they smacked their bodies were heavy with cold seawater; and drenched with cold brine was their matted hair. 
JoycJA.txt	301	1.5	1916	Joyce, James	A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man	  —Yes, yes, the ladies are coming round to us. I can see it every day. The ladies are with us. The best helpers the language has.    —And the church, Father Moran?    —The church too. Coming round too. The work is going ahead there too. Don't fret about the church.    Bah! he had done well to leave the room in disdain. He had done well not to salute her on the steps of the library! He had done well to leave her to flirt with her priest, to toy with a church which was the scullery-maid of christendom.    Rude brutal anger routed the last lingering instant of ecstasy from his soul. It broke up violently her fair image and flung the fragments on all sides. On all sides distorted reflections of her image started from his memory: the flower girl in the ragged dress with damp coarse hair and a hoyden's face who had called herself his own girl and begged his handsel, the kitchen-girl in the next house who sang over the clatter of her plates, with the drawl of a country singer, the first bars of BY KILLARNEY'S LAKES AND FELLS, a girl who had laughed gaily to see him stumble when the iron grating in the footpath near Cork Hill had caught the broken sole of his shoe, a girl he had glanced at, attracted by her small ripe mouth, as she passed out of Jacob's biscuit factory, who had cried to him over her shoulder:    —Do you like what you seen of me, straight hair and curly eyebrows? 
JoycJA.txt	324	10.0	1916	Joyce, James	A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man	  His step was angry and with an angry abrupt gesture he thrust the stick back into Stephen's hand. Stephen felt that his anger had another cause but, feigning patience, touched his arm slightly and said quietly:    —Cranly, I told you I wanted to speak to you. Come away.    Cranly looked at him for a few moments and asked:    —Now?    —Yes, now, Stephen said. We can't speak here. Come away.    They crossed the quadrangle together without speaking. The bird call from SIEGFRIED whistled softly followed them from the steps of the porch. Cranly turned, and Dixon, who had whistled, called out:    —Where are you fellows off to? What about that game, Cranly?    They parleyed in shouts across the still air about a game of billiards to be played in the Adelphi hotel. Stephen walked on alone and out into the quiet of Kildare Street opposite Maple's hotel he stood to wait, patient again. The name of the hotel, a colourless polished wood, and its colourless front stung him like a glance of polite disdain. He stared angrily back at the softly lit drawing-room of the hotel in which he imagined the sleek lives of the patricians of Ireland housed in calm. They thought of army commissions and land agents: peasants greeted them along the roads in the country; they knew the names of certain French dishes and gave orders to jarvies in high-pitched provincial voices which pierced through their skin-tight accents. 
JoycJA.txt	344	1440.0	1916	Joyce, James	A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man	  APRIL 15. Met her today point blank in Grafton Street. The crowd brought us together. We both stopped. She asked me why I never came, said she had heard all sorts of stories about me. This was only to gain time. Asked me was I writing poems? About whom? I asked her. This confused her more and I felt sorry and mean. Turned off that valve at once and opened the spiritual-heroic refrigerating apparatus, invented and patented in all countries by Dante Alighieri. Talked rapidly of myself and my plans. In the midst of it unluckily I made a sudden gesture of a revolutionary nature. I must have looked like a fellow throwing a handful of peas into the air. People began to look at us. She shook hands a moment after and, in going away, said she hoped I would do what I said.    Now I call that friendly, don't you?    Yes, I liked her today. A little or much? Don't know. I liked her and it seems a new feeling to me. Then, in that case, all the rest, all that I thought I thought and all that I felt I felt, all the rest before now, in fact... O, give it up, old chap! Sleep it off!    APRIL 16. Away! Away!

They are held out to say: We are alone—come. And the voices say with them: We are your kinsmen. And the air is thick with their company as they call to me, their kinsman, making ready to go, shaking the wings of their exultant and terrible youth.    APRIL 26. Mother is putting my new secondhand clothes in order. She prays now, she says, that I may learn in my own life and away from home and friends what the heart is and what it feels. Amen. So be it.

greatexpectations.txt	0	5256000.0	1861	Dickens, Charles	Great Expectations	    GREAT EXPECTATIONS    [1867 Edition]    by Charles Dickens    Chapter I    My father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip, my  infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit  than Pip. So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip.    I give Pirrip as my father's family name, on the authority of his  tombstone and my sister,--Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith.  As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness  of either of them (for their days were long before the days of  photographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like were  unreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on  my father's, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man,  with curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription,  "Also Georgiana Wife of the Above," I drew a childish conclusion that  my mother was freckled and sickly. To five little stone lozenges, each  about a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside  their grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of  mine,--who gave up trying to get a living, exceedingly early in  that universal struggle,--I am indebted for a belief I religiously  entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands  in their trousers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state of  existence. 
greatexpectations.txt	1	1.0	1861	Dickens, Charles	Great Expectations	  Ours was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the river  wound, twenty miles of the sea. My first most vivid and broad impression  of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on a memorable  raw afternoon towards evening. At such a time I found out for certain  that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the churchyard; and  that Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and also Georgiana wife of the  above, were dead and buried; and that Alexander, Bartholomew, Abraham,  Tobias, and Roger, infant children of the aforesaid, were also dead  and buried; and that the dark flat wilderness beyond the churchyard,  intersected with dikes and mounds and gates, with scattered cattle  feeding on it, was the marshes; and that the low leaden line beyond  was the river; and that the distant savage lair from which the wind was  rushing was the sea; and that the small bundle of shivers growing afraid  of it all and beginning to cry, was Pip.    "Hold your noise!" cried a terrible voice, as a man started up from  among the graves at the side of the church porch. "Keep still, you  little devil, or I'll cut your throat!"    A fearful man, all in coarse gray, with a great iron on his leg. A man  with no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round his  head. A man who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, and  lamed by stones, and cut by flints, and stung by nettles, and torn by  briars; who limped, and shivered, and glared, and growled; and whose  teeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin. 
greatexpectations.txt	119	4.0	1861	Dickens, Charles	Great Expectations	  It opened to the ground, and looked into a most miserable corner of the  neglected garden, upon a rank ruin of cabbage-stalks, and one box-tree  that had been clipped round long ago, like a pudding, and had a new  growth at the top of it, out of shape and of a different color, as if  that part of the pudding had stuck to the saucepan and got burnt. This  was my homely thought, as I contemplated the box-tree. There had been  some light snow, overnight, and it lay nowhere else to my knowledge;  but, it had not quite melted from the cold shadow of this bit of garden,  and the wind caught it up in little eddies and threw it at the window,  as if it pelted me for coming there.    I divined that my coming had stopped conversation in the room, and that  its other occupants were looking at me. I could see nothing of the room  except the shining of the fire in the window-glass, but I stiffened in  all my joints with the consciousness that I was under close inspection.    There were three ladies in the room and one gentleman. Before I had been  standing at the window five minutes, they somehow conveyed to me that  they were all toadies and humbugs, but that each of them pretended not  to know that the others were toadies and humbugs: because the admission  that he or she did know it, would have made him or her out to be a toady  and humbug. 
greatexpectations.txt	187	1440.0	1861	Dickens, Charles	Great Expectations	  Biddy's first triumph in her new office, was to solve a difficulty  that had completely vanquished me. I had tried hard at it, but had made  nothing of it. Thus it was:--    Again and again and again, my sister had traced upon the slate, a  character that looked like a curious T, and then with the utmost  eagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly  wanted. I had in vain tried everything producible that began with a T,  from tar to toast and tub. At length it had come into my head that the  sign looked like a hammer, and on my lustily calling that word in my  sister's ear, she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a  qualified assent. Thereupon, I had brought in all our hammers, one after  another, but without avail. Then I bethought me of a crutch, the shape  being much the same, and I borrowed one in the village, and displayed  it to my sister with considerable confidence. But she shook her head to  that extent when she was shown it, that we were terrified lest in her  weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck.    When my sister found that Biddy was very quick to understand her, this  mysterious sign reappeared on the slate. Biddy looked thoughtfully  at it, heard my explanation, looked thoughtfully at my sister, looked  thoughtfully at Joe (who was always represented on the slate by his  initial letter), and ran into the forge, followed by Joe and me. 
greatexpectations.txt	192	5.0	1861	Dickens, Charles	Great Expectations	  What could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it  dropped on her work? I sat silent, recalling what a drudge she had been  until Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt successfully overcame that bad habit of  living, so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people. I recalled  the hopeless circumstances by which she had been surrounded in the  miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school,  with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and  shouldered. I reflected that even in those untoward times there must  have been latent in Biddy what was now developing, for, in my first  uneasiness and discontent I had turned to her for help, as a matter of  course. Biddy sat quietly sewing, shedding no more tears, and while I  looked at her and thought about it all, it occurred to me that perhaps  I had not been sufficiently grateful to Biddy. I might have been too  reserved, and should have patronized her more (though I did not use that  precise word in my meditations) with my confidence.    "Yes, Biddy," I observed, when I had done turning it over, "you were my  first teacher, and that at a time when we little thought of ever being  together like this, in this kitchen."    "Ah, poor thing!" replied Biddy. It was like her self-forgetfulness to  transfer the remark to my sister, and to get up and be busy about her,  making her more comfortable; "that's sadly true!" 
greatexpectations.txt	271	45.0	1861	Dickens, Charles	Great Expectations	  I thanked him and said I would. I informed him in exchange that my  Christian name was Philip.    "I don't take to Philip," said he, smiling, "for it sounds like a moral  boy out of the spelling-book, who was so lazy that he fell into a pond,  or so fat that he couldn't see out of his eyes, or so avaricious that  he locked up his cake till the mice ate it, or so determined to go a  bird's-nesting that he got himself eaten by bears who lived handy in the  neighborhood. I tell you what I should like. We are so harmonious, and  you have been a blacksmith,---would you mind it?"    "I shouldn't mind anything that you propose," I answered, "but I don't  understand you."    "Would you mind Handel for a familiar name? There's a charming piece of  music by Handel, called the Harmonious Blacksmith."    "I should like it very much."    "Then, my dear Handel," said he, turning round as the door opened,  "here is the dinner, and I must beg of you to take the top of the table,  because the dinner is of your providing."    This I would not hear of, so he took the top, and I faced him. It was a  nice little dinner,--seemed to me then a very Lord Mayor's Feast,--and  it acquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent  circumstances, with no old people by, and with London all around us.

Therefore we had sat,  feeling keenly for him, but laughing, nevertheless, from ear to ear. I  laughed in spite of myself all the time, the whole thing was so droll;  and yet I had a latent impression that there was something decidedly  fine in Mr. Wopsle's elocution,--not for old associations' sake, I am  afraid, but because it was very slow, very dreary, very uphill and  downhill, and very unlike any way in which any man in any natural  circumstances of life or death ever expressed himself about anything.  When the tragedy was over, and he had been called for and hooted, I said  to Herbert, "Let us go at once, or perhaps we shall meet him."    We made all the haste we could downstairs, but we were not quick enough  either. Standing at the door was a Jewish man with an unnatural heavy  smear of eyebrow, who caught my eyes as we advanced, and said, when we  came up with him,--    "Mr. Pip and friend?"    Identity of Mr. Pip and friend confessed.    "Mr. Waldengarver," said the man, "would be glad to have the honor."    "Waldengarver?" I repeated--when Herbert murmured in my ear, "Probably  Wopsle."    "Oh!" said I. "Yes. Shall we follow you?"    "A few steps, please." When we were in a side alley, he turned and  asked, "How did you think he looked?--I dressed him." 
greatexpectations.txt	449	180.0	1861	Dickens, Charles	Great Expectations	  "Ah!" said I, pressing him, for I thought I saw him near a loophole  here; "but would that be your opinion at Walworth?"    "Mr. Pip," he replied, with gravity, "Walworth is one place, and this  office is another. Much as the Aged is one person, and Mr. Jaggers is  another. They must not be confounded together. My Walworth sentiments  must be taken at Walworth; none but my official sentiments can be taken  in this office."    "Very well," said I, much relieved, "then I shall look you up at  Walworth, you may depend upon it."    "Mr. Pip," he returned, "you will be welcome there, in a private and  personal capacity."    We had held this conversation in a low voice, well knowing my guardian's  ears to be the sharpest of the sharp. As he now appeared in his doorway,  towelling his hands, Wemmick got on his great-coat and stood by to snuff  out the candles. We all three went into the street together, and from  the door-step Wemmick turned his way, and Mr. Jaggers and I turned ours.    I could not help wishing more than once that evening, that Mr. Jaggers  had had an Aged in Gerrard Street, or a Stinger, or a Something, or  a Somebody, to unbend his brows a little. It was an uncomfortable  consideration on a twenty-first birthday, that coming of age at all  seemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as he  made of it. He was a thousand times better informed and cleverer than  Wemmick, and yet I would a thousand times rather have had Wemmick to  dinner. And Mr. Jaggers made not me alone intensely melancholy, because,  after he was gone, Herbert said of himself, with his eyes fixed on the  fire, that he thought he must have committed a felony and forgotten the  details of it, he felt so dejected and guilty.

I seemed to have been dozing a  whole night when the clocks struck six. As there was full an hour and  a half between me and daylight, I dozed again; now, waking up uneasily,  with prolix conversations about nothing, in my ears; now, making thunder  of the wind in the chimney; at length, falling off into a profound sleep  from which the daylight woke me with a start.    All this time I had never been able to consider my own situation, nor  could I do so yet. I had not the power to attend to it. I was greatly  dejected and distressed, but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way.  As to forming any plan for the future, I could as soon have formed an  elephant. When I opened the shutters and looked out at the wet wild  morning, all of a leaden hue; when I walked from room to room; when I  sat down again shivering, before the fire, waiting for my laundress to  appear; I thought how miserable I was, but hardly knew why, or how long  I had been so, or on what day of the week I made the reflection, or even  who I was that made it.

Others has done it safe afore, and what  others has done afore, others can do agen. As to the where and how of  living, dear boy, give me your own opinions on it."    "You take it smoothly now," said I, "but you were very serious last  night, when you swore it was Death."    "And so I swear it is Death," said he, putting his pipe back in his  mouth, "and Death by the rope, in the open street not fur from this, and  it's serious that you should fully understand it to be so. What then,  when that's once done? Here I am. To go back now 'ud be as bad as to  stand ground--worse. Besides, Pip, I'm here, because I've meant it by  you, years and years. As to what I dare, I'm a old bird now, as has  dared all manner of traps since first he was fledged, and I'm not afeerd  to perch upon a scarecrow. If there's Death hid inside of it, there is,  and let him come out, and I'll face him, and then I'll believe in him  and not afore. And now let me have a look at my gentleman agen."    Once more, he took me by both hands and surveyed me with an air of  admiring proprietorship: smoking with great complacency all the while. 
greatexpectations.txt	513	300.0	1861	Dickens, Charles	Great Expectations	  As he was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit, in which he  looked as if he had some parrots and cigars to dispose of, I next  discussed with him what dress he should wear. He cherished an  extraordinary belief in the virtues of "shorts" as a disguise, and had  in his own mind sketched a dress for himself that would have made  him something between a dean and a dentist. It was with considerable  difficulty that I won him over to the assumption of a dress more like a  prosperous farmer's; and we arranged that he should cut his hair close,  and wear a little powder. Lastly, as he had not yet been seen by the  laundress or her niece, he was to keep himself out of their view until  his change of dress was made.    It would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions; but in my  dazed, not to say distracted, state, it took so long, that I did not  get out to further them until two or three in the afternoon. He was to  remain shut up in the chambers while I was gone, and was on no account  to open the door.

"Take it in  your right hand. Lord strike you dead on the spot, if ever you split in  any way sumever! Kiss it!"    "Do so, as he wishes it," I said to Herbert. So, Herbert, looking at  me with a friendly uneasiness and amazement, complied, and Provis  immediately shaking hands with him, said, "Now you're on your oath, you  know. And never believe me on mine, if Pip shan't make a gentleman on  you!"          Chapter XLI    In vain should I attempt to describe the astonishment and disquiet  of Herbert, when he and I and Provis sat down before the fire, and I  recounted the whole of the secret. Enough, that I saw my own feelings  reflected in Herbert's face, and not least among them, my repugnance  towards the man who had done so much for me.    What would alone have set a division between that man and us, if there  had been no other dividing circumstance, was his triumph in my story.  Saving his troublesome sense of having been "low" on one occasion since  his return,--on which point he began to hold forth to Herbert, the  moment my revelation was finished,--he had no perception of the  possibility of my finding any fault with my good fortune. His boast that  he had made me a gentleman, and that he had come to see me support the  character on his ample resources, was made for me quite as much as for  himself. And that it was a highly agreeable boast to both of us,  and that we must both be very proud of it, was a conclusion quite  established in his own mind.

When I raised my face again, there was such a  ghastly look upon Miss Havisham's, that it impressed me, even in my  passionate hurry and grief.    "Estella, dearest Estella, do not let Miss Havisham lead you into this  fatal step. Put me aside for ever,--you have done so, I well know,--but  bestow yourself on some worthier person than Drummle. Miss Havisham  gives you to him, as the greatest slight and injury that could be done  to the many far better men who admire you, and to the few who truly  love you. Among those few there may be one who loves you even as dearly,  though he has not loved you as long, as I. Take him, and I can bear it  better, for your sake!"    My earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would have  been touched with compassion, if she could have rendered me at all  intelligible to her own mind.    "I am going," she said again, in a gentler voice, "to be married to  him. The preparations for my marriage are making, and I shall be  married soon. Why do you injuriously introduce the name of my mother by  adoption? It is my own act."    "Your own act, Estella, to fling yourself away upon a brute?"

You must have been under lock and key, dear boy, to know it equal to  me,--but I ain't a going to be low."    It occurred to me as inconsistent, that, for any mastering idea, he  should have endangered his freedom, and even his life. But I reflected  that perhaps freedom without danger was too much apart from all the  habit of his existence to be to him what it would be to another man. I  was not far out, since he said, after smoking a little:--    "You see, dear boy, when I was over yonder, t'other side the world, I  was always a looking to this side; and it come flat to be there, for  all I was a growing rich. Everybody knowed Magwitch, and Magwitch could  come, and Magwitch could go, and nobody's head would be troubled about  him. They ain't so easy concerning me here, dear boy,--wouldn't be,  leastwise, if they knowed where I was."    "If all goes well," said I, "you will be perfectly free and safe again  within a few hours."    "Well," he returned, drawing a long breath, "I hope so."    "And think so?"

And if you could say that to me then, you will not hesitate to say that to me now,--now, when suffering has been stronger than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be. I have been bent and broken, but--I hope--into a better shape. Be as considerate and good to me as you were, and tell me we are friends." "We are friends," said I, rising and bending over her, as she rose from the bench. "And will continue friends apart," said Estella. I took her hand in mine, and we went out of the ruined place; and, as the morning mists had risen long ago when I first left the forge, so the evening mists were rising now, and in all the broad expanse of tranquil light they showed to me, I saw no shadow of another parting from her.

"PEACE to the spirits of my honoured parents, respected be their remains, and immortalized their virtues! may time, while it moulders their frail relicks to dust, commit to tradition the record of their goodness; and Oh may their orphan-descendant be influenced through life by the remembrance of their purity, and be solaced in death, that by her it was unsullied!"  Such was the secret prayer with which the only survivor of the Beverley family quitted the abode of her youth, and residence of her forefathers; while tears of recollecting sorrow filled her eyes, and obstructed    the last view of her native town which had excited them.  Cecilia, this fair traveller, had lately entered into the one-and-twentieth year of her age. Her ancestors had been rich farmers in the county of Suffolk, though her father, in whom a spirit of elegance had supplanted the rapacity of wealth, had spent his time as a private country gentleman, satisfied, without increasing his store, to live upon what he inherited from the labours of his predecessors. She had lost him in her early youth, and her mother had not long survived him. They had bequeathed to her 10,000 l. and consigned her to the care of the Dean of , her uncle. With this gentleman, in whom, by various contingencies, the accumulated possessions of a rising and prosperous family were centred, she had passed the last four years of her life; and a few weeks only had yet elapsed since his death, which, by depriving her of her last relation, made her heiress to an estate of 3000 l. per annum; with no other restriction than that of annexing her name, if she married, to the disposal of her hand and her riches.

But though thus largely indebted to fortune, to nature she had yet greater obligations: her form was elegant, her heart was liberal; her countenance announced the intelligence    of her mind, her complexion varied with every emotion of her soul, and her eyes, the heralds of her speech, now beamed with understanding and now glistened with sensibility.  For the short period of her minority, the management of her fortune and the care of her person, had by the Dean been entrusted to three guardians, among whom her own choice was to settle her residence: but her mind, saddened by the loss of all her natural friends, coveted to regain its serenity in the quietness of the country, and in the bosom of an aged and maternal counsellor, whom she loved as her mother, and to whom she had been known from her childhood.  The Deanery, indeed, she was obliged to relinquish, a long repining expectant being eager, by entering it, to bequeath to another the anxiety and suspence he had suffered himself; though probably without much impatience to shorten their duration in favour of the next successor; but the house of Mrs. Charlton, her benevolent friend, was open for her reception, and the alleviating tenderness of her conversation took from her all wish of changing it.  Here she had dwelt since the interment of her uncle; and here, from the affectionate gratitude of her disposition, she had perhaps    been content to dwell till her own, had not her guardians interfered to remove her.

"So valourous a Don Quixote," returned he, laughing, "certainly merited a faithful Esquire! he was, however, gone out, and nobody knew whither. About half an hour ago I called upon him again; he was then just returned home."  "Well, Sir?"  "I saw him; the affair was over; and in a short time he will be able, if you will allow him so much honour, to thank you for these enquiries."  "He is then wounded?"  "He is a little hurt, but Sir Robert is perfectly safe. Belfield fired first, and missed; the Baronet was not so successless."  "I am grieved to hear it, indeed! and where is the wound?"  "The ball entered his right side, and the moment he felt it, he fired his second pistol in the air. This I heard from his servant. He was brought home carefully and slowly; no surgeon had been upon the    spot, but one was called to him immediately. I stayed to enquire his opinion after the wound had been dressed: he told me he had extracted the ball, and assured me Mr. Belfield was not in any danger. Your alarm, madam, last night, which had always been present to me, then encouraged me to take the liberty of waiting upon you; for I concluded you could yet have had no certain intelligence, and thought it best to let the plain and simple fact out-run the probable exaggeration of rumour."

"Your rejection, therefore," continued he, "of this honourable offer, may perhaps have been merely the consequence of    the principles in which you have been educated.  "Rejection?" interrupted Cecilia, amazed, "what rejection, Sir?"  "Have you not refused the proposals of my Lord Ernolf for his son?"  "Lord Ernolf? never! nor have I ever seen either his Lordship or his son but in public."  "That," replied Mr. Delvile, "is little to the purpose; where the connexion is a proper one, a young lady of delicacy has only to accede to it. But though this rejection came not immediately from yourself, it had doubtless your concurrence."  "It had not, Sir, even my knowledge."  "Your alliance then with Sir Robert Floyer is probably nearer a conclusion than I had imagined, for otherwise Mr. Harrel would not, without consulting you, have given the Earl so determinate an answer.  "No, Sir," said Cecilia, impatiently, "my alliance with him was never more distant, nor do I mean it should ever approach more near."  She was now little disposed for further conversation. Her heroic design of refusing young Delvile by no means reconciled her to the discovery she now made that he had not meant to address her; and though she was provoked and fretted at this new proof    that Mr. Harrel scrupled neither assertions nor actions to make her engagement with Sir Robert credited, her disappointment in finding that Mr. Delvile, instead of pleading the cause of his son, was exerting his interest for another person, affected her so much more nearly, that notwithstanding he still continued his parading harangue, she scarcely knew even the subject of his discourse, and seized the first opportunity of a cessation to rise and take her leave.

"Yes; but not more than it costs his neighbours to keep him in countenance. Miss Leeson, since she has presided over the sect of the SUPERCILIOUS, spends at least half her life in wishing the annihilation of the other half; for as she must only speak in her own Coterie, she is compelled to be frequently silent, and therefore, having nothing to think of, she is commonly gnawn with self-denial, and soured with want of amusement: Miss Larolles, indeed, is better off, for in talking faster than she thinks, she has but followed the natural bent of her disposition: as to this poor JARGONIST, he has, I must own, rather a hard task, from the continual restraint of speaking only out of his own Liliputian vocabulary, and denying himself the relief of ever uttering one word by the call of occasion: but what hardship is that, compared with what is borne by Mr. Meadows? who, since he commenced INSENSIBLIST, has never once dared to be    pleased, nor ventured for a moment to look in good humour!"  "Surely, then," said Cecilia, "in a short time, the punishment of this affectation will bring its cure."

"You may repeat it, Sir, if you please," said Cecilia, piqued that he had not rather    thought of himself than of Lord Ernolf, "to the whole Pantheon."  "And if I should," cried he, "half of it, at least, would thank me; and to obtain the applause of so noble an assembly, what would it signify that Sir Robert should cut my throat?"  "I believe," said Cecilia, deeply mortified by a raillery that shewed so little interest in her avowal of indifference, "you are determined to make me as sick of that man's name, as I am of his conversation."  "And is it possible," exclaimed Delvile, in a tone of surprise, "that such can be your opinion, and yet, situated as you are, the whole world at your command, and all mankind at your devotion but I am answering you seriously, when you are only speaking by rule."  "What rule, Sir?"  "That which young ladies, upon certain occasions, always prescribe themselves."  Here they were interrupted by the arrival of the rest of the company; though not before Cecilia had received some little consolation for her displeasure, by finding that young Delvile still supposed she was engaged, and flattering herself his language would be different were he informed of the contrary.

"Why, Sir, this will prove an expensive expedition to you," said Mr. Gosport, very gravely; "Have you cast up what it may cost you?"  "More than it's worth, more than it's worth," answered he pettishly; "ha'n't laid out so much in pleasure these five years."  "Ha! ha!" cried Morrice, hallowing aloud, why it can't be more than sixpence in all!"  "Sixpence?" repeated he scornfully, "if you don't know the value of sixpence, you'll never be worth fivepence three farthings. How do think got rich, hay? by wearing fine coats, and frizzling my pate? No, no; Master Harrel for that! ask him if he'll cast an account with me! never knew a man worth a penny with such a coat as that on."  Morrice again laughed, and again Mr. Briggs reproved him; and Cecilia, taking advantage of the squabble, stole back to the music-room.  Here, in a few minutes, Mrs. Panton, a lady who frequently visited at the house, approached Cecilia, followed by a gentleman, whom she had never before seen, but    who was so evidently charmed with her, that he had looked at no other object since his entrance into the house.  Mrs. Panton, presenting him to her by the name of Mr. Marriot, told her he had begged her intercession for the honour of her hand in the two first dances: and the moment she answered that she was already engaged, the same request was made for the two following. Cecilia had then no excuse, and was therefore obliged to accept him.

Don't you think this room is very close? I must go and try another atmosphere,  But  I hope you will relent, and dance?"  And then, stretching his arms as if half asleep, he sauntered into the next room, where he flung himself upon a sofa till the ball was over.  The new partner of Cecilia, who was a wealthy, but very simple young man, used his utmost efforts to entertain and oblige her, and, flattered by the warmth of his own desire, he fancied that he succeeded; though, in a state of such suspence and anxiety, a man of brighter talents had failed.  At the end of the two dances, Lord Ernolf again attempted to engage her for his son, but she now excused herself from dancing any more, and sat quietly as a spectatress till the rest of the company gave over. Mr. Marriot, however, would not quit her, and she was compelled to support with him a trifling conversation, which, though irksome to herself, to him, who had not seen her in her happier hour, was delightful.  She expected every instant to be again joined by young Delvile, but the expectation was disappointed; he came not; she concluded he was in another apartment; the company was summoned to supper, she then thought it impossible to miss him; but, after waiting and looking for him in    vain, she found he had already left the house.

And, when she hesitated in her compliance, he suriously accused her of having brought on    all this distress by her negligence and want of management, and declared that if she did not get the money, she would only be served as she merited by starving in a foreign gaol, which he swore would be the fate of them both.  The horror and indignation with which Cecilia heard this account were unspeakable. She saw evidently that she was again to be played upon by terror and distress, and the cautions and opinions of Mr. Monckton no longer appeared overstrained; one year's income was already demanded, the annuity and the country house might next be required: she rejoiced, however, that thus wisely forwarned, she was not liable to surprise, and she determined, be their entreaties or representations what they might, to be immovably steady in her purpose of leaving them the next morning.  Yet she could not but grieve at suffering the whole burthen of this clamorous imposition to fall upon the soft-hearted Mr. Arnott, whose inability to resist solicitation made him so unequal to sustaining its weight: but when Mrs. Harrel was again able to go on with her account, she heard, to her infinite surprise, that all application to her brother had proved fruitless. "He will not hear me," continued Mrs. Harrel, "and he never was deaf to me before! so    now I have lost my only and last resource, my brother himself gives me up, and there is no one else upon earth who will assist me!"

THE next morning the family purposed setting off as soon as breakfast was over: young Delvile, however, waited not so long; the fineness of the weather tempted him, he said, to travel on horseback, and therefore he had risen very early, and was already gone. Cecilia could not but wonder, yet did not repine.  Just as breakfast was over, and Mr. and Mrs. Delvile and Cecilia were preparing to depart, to their no little surprise, the door was opened, and, out of breath with haste and with heat, in stumpt Mr. Briggs! "So," cried he, to Cecilia, "what's all this? hay? where are going? a coach at the door! horses to every wheel! Servants fine as lords! what's in the wind now? think to chouse me out of my belongings?"  "I thought, Sir," said Cecilia, who instantly understood him, though Mr. and Mrs. Delvile stared at him in utter astonishment, "I had explained before I left you that I should not return."    "Did n't, did n't!" answered he, angrily; "waited for you three days, dressed a breast o' mutton o' purpose; got in a lobster, and two crabs; all spoilt by keeping; stink already; weather quite muggy, forced to souse 'em in vinegar; one expence brings on another; never begin the like agen."  "I am very sorry, indeed," said Cecilia, much disconcerted, "if there has been any mistake through my neglect; but I had hoped I was understood, and I have been so much occupied "

Cecilia, surprised and affected, gratified and depressed, remained almost motionless, and could not, for a great length of time, either ring for her maid, or persuade herself    to go to rest. She saw throughout the whole behaviour of Mrs. Delvile, a warmth of regard which, though strongly opposed by family pride, made her almost miserable to promote the very union she thought necessary to discountenance; she saw, too, that it was with the utmost difficulty she preserved the steadiness of her opposition, and that she had a conflict perpetual with herself, to forbear openly acknowledging the contrariety of her wishes, and the perplexity of her distress; but chiefly she was struck with her expressive use of the word gratitude. "Wherefore should she be grateful, thought Cecilia, what have I done, or had power to do? infinitely, indeed, is she deceived, if she supposes that her son has acted by my directions; my influence with him is nothing, and he could not be more his own master, were he utterly indifferent to me. To conceal my own disappointment has been all I have attempted; and perhaps she may think of me thus highly, from supposing that the firmness of her son is owing to my caution and reserve: ah, she knows him not! were my heart at this moment laid open to him, were all its weakness, its partiality, its ill-fated admiration displayed, he would but double his vigilance to avoid and forget me, and find    the task all the easier by his abatement of esteem. Oh strange infatuation of unconquerable prejudice! his very life will sacrifice in preference to his name, a while the conflict of his mind threatens t level him with the dust, he disdains to unit himself where one wish is unsatisfied!"

"Upon you, madam," he continued, "all that is good or evil of my future life, as far as relates to its happiness or misery, will, from this very hour, almost solely depend: yet much as I rely upon your goodness, and superior as I know you to trifling    or affectation, what I now come to propose to petition to entreat I cannot summon courage to mention, from a dread of alarming you!"  What next, thought Cecilia, trembling at this introduction, is preparing for me! does he mean to ask me to solicit Mrs. Delvile's consent! or from myself must he receive commands that we should never meet more!  "Is Miss Beverley," cried he, "determined not to speak to me? Is she bent upon silence only to intimidate me? Indeed if she knew how greatly I respect her, she would honour me with more confidence."  "When, Sir," cried she, "do you mean to make your tour?"  "Never!" cried he, with fervour, "unless banished by you, never! no, loveliest Miss Beverley, I can now quit you no more! Fortune, beauty, worth and sweetness I had power to relinquish, and severe as was the task, I compelled myself to perform it, but when to these I find joined so attractive a softness, a pity for my sufferings so unexpectedly gentle no! sweetest Miss Beverley, I can quit you no more!" And then, seizing her hand, with yet greater energy, he went on, "I here," he cried, "offer you my vows, I here own you sole arbitress of my sate! I give you not merely the possession of my heart, that, indeed,    I had no power to with-hold from you, but I give you the direction of my conduct, I entreat you to become my counsellor and guide. Will Miss Beverley accept such an office? Will she deign to listen to such a prayer?"

"Not merely have I prescribed," returned Belfield, "I have already put them in practice; and far from finding any pennance, I never before found happiness. I have now adopted, though poor, the very plan of life I should have elected if rich; my pleasure, therefore, is become my business, and my business my pleasure."  "And is this plan," cried Monckton, "nothing more than turning Knight-errant to the Booksellers?"  "'Tis a Knight-errantry," answered Belfield, laughing, "which, however ludicrous it may seem to you, requires more soul and more brains than any other. Our giants may, indeed, be only windmills, but they must be attacked with as much spirit, and conquered with as much bravery, as any fort or any town, in time of war should be demolished; and though the siege, I must confess, may be of less national utility, the assailants of the quill have their honour as much at heart as the assailants of the sword."  "I suppose then," said Monckton, archly, "if a man wants a biting lampoon, or an handsome panegyric, some news-paper scandal, or a a sonnet for a lady "  "No, no," interrupted Belfield eagerly,    "if you imagine me a hireling scribble for the purposes of defamation or of flattery, you as little know my situation as my character. My subjects shall be my own, and my satire shall be general. I would as much disdain to be personal with an anonymous pen, as to attack an unarmed man in the dark with a dagger I had kept concealed."

"She departs," resumed Albany, "the envy of the world! while yet no guilt had seized her soul, and no remorse had marred her peace. She was the hand-maid of charity, and pity dwelt in her bosom! her mouth was never opened but to give comfort; her footsteps were followed by blessings! Oh happy in purity, be thine the song of triumph! softly shalt thou sink to temporary sleep, sublimely shalt thou rise to life that wakes for ever!"  He then got up, took the children by their little hands, and went away.        CHAP. X. A TERMINATION.  DR. Lyster and Delvile met them at the entrance into the house. Extremely alarmed lest Cecilia had received any disturbance, they both hastened up stairs, but Delvile proceeded only to the door. He stopt there and listened; but all was silent: the prayers of Albany had struck an awe into every one; and Dr. Lyster soon returned to tell him there was no alteration in his patient.  "And he has not disturbed her?" cried Delvile.  "No, not at all."  "I think, then," said he, advancing, though trembling, "I will yet see her once more."  "No, no, Mr. Mortimer," cried the doctor, "why should you give yourself so unnecessary a shock?"  "The shock," answered he, "is over! tell me, however, is there any chance I may hurt her? "  "I believe not; I do not think, just now, she will perceive you."

The tender-hearted Henrietta, in returning to her new friends, gave way, with artless openness, to the violence of untamed grief; but finding Mr. Arnott as wretched    as herself, the sympathy Cecilia had foreseen soon endeared them to each other, while the little interest taken in either by Mrs. Harrel, made them almost inseparable companions.  Mrs. Harrel, wearied by their melancholy, and sick of retirement, took the earliest opportunity that was offered her of changing her situation; she married very soon a man of fortune in the neighbourhood, and, quickly forgetting all the past, thoughtlessly began the world again, with new hopes, new connections, new equipages and new engagements!  Henrietta was then obliged to go again to her mother, where, though deprived of all the indulgencies to which she was now become familiar, she was not more hurt by the separation than Mr. Arnott. So sad and so solitary his house seemed in her absence, that he soon followed her to town, and returned not till he carried her back its mistress. And there the gentle gratitude of her soft and feeling heart, engaged from the worthy Mr. Arnott the tenderest affection, and, in time, healed the wound of his early and hopeless passion.  The injudicious, the volatile, yet nobleminded Belfield, to whose mutable and enterprising disposition life seemed always rather beginning than progressive, roved from employment to employment, and from    public life to retirement, soured with the world, and discontented with himself, till vanquished, at length, by the constant friendship of Delvile, he consented to accept his good offices in again entering the army; and, being fortunately ordered out upon foreign service, his hopes were revived by ambition, and his prospects were brightened by a view of future honour.

The wretched Monckton, dupe of his own cunning and artifices, still lived in lingering misery, doubtful which was most acute, the pain of his wound and confinement, or of his defeat and disappointment. Led on by a vain belief that he had parts to conquer all difficulties, he had indulged without restraint a passion in which interest was seconded by inclination. Allured by such fascinating powers, he shortly suffered nothing to stop his course; and though when he began his career he would have started at the mention of actual dishonour, long before it was concluded, neither treachery nor perjury were regarded by him as stumbling blocks. All fear of failing was lost in vanity, all sense of probity was sunk in interest, all scruples of conscience were left behind by the heat of the chace. Yet the unforeseen and melancholy catastrophe of his long arts, illustrated in his despite what his principles had obscured,    that even in worldly pursuits where fraud out-runs integrity, failure joins dishonour to loss, and disappointment excites triumph instead of pity.  The upright mind of Cecilia, her purity, her virtue, and the moderation of her wishes, gave to her in the warm affection of Lady Delvile, and the unremitting fondness of Mortimer, all the happiness human life seems capable of receiving: yet human it was, and as such imperfect! she knew that, at times, the whole family must murmur at her loss of fortune, and at times she murmured herself to be thus portionless, tho' an HEIRESS. Rationally, however, she surveyed the world at large, and finding that of the few who had any happiness, there were none without some misery, she checked the rising sigh of repining mortality, and, grateful with general felicity, bore partial evil with chearfullest resignation. 
thevirginian.txt	0	10.0	1902	Wister, Owen	The Virginian	ENTER THE MAN  SOME notable sight was drawing the passengers,  both men and women, to the window; and therefore  I rose and crossed the car to see what it was.  I saw near the track an enclosure, and round it  some laughing men, and inside it some whirling  dust, and amid the dust some horses, plunging,  huddling, and dodging. They were cow ponies  in a corral, and one of them would not be caught,  no matter who threw the rope. We had plenty  of time to watch this sport, for our train had  stopped that the engine might take water at the  tank before it pulled us up beside the station platform  of Medicine Bow. We were also six hours  late, and starving for entertainment. The pony  in the corral was wise, and rapid of limb. Have  you seen a skilful boxer watch his antagonist with  a quiet, incessant eye ? Such an eye as this did  the pony keep upon whatever man took the rope.  The man might pretend to look at the weather,  which was fine; or he might affect earnest conversation  with a bystatider: it was bootless. The  pony saw through it. No feint hoodwinked him.  This animal was thoroughly a man of the world. 
thevirginian.txt	1	2.0	1902	Wister, Owen	The Virginian	His undistracted eye stayed fixed upon the dissem  a THE VIRGINIAN  bling foe, and the gravity of his horse expression  made the matter one of high comedy. Then the  rope would sail out at him, but he was already  elsewhere; and if horses laugh, gaiety must have  abounded in that corral. Sometimes the pony  took a turn alone; next he had slid in a flash  among his brothers, and the whole of them like a  school oj: playful fish whipped round the corral,  kicking up the fine dust, and (I take it) roaring  with laughter. Through the window glass of our  Pullman the thud of their mischievous hoofs  reached us, and the strong, humorous curses of  the cow boys. Then for the first time I noticed  a man who sat on the high gate of the corral,  looking on. For he now climbed down with the  undulations of a tiger, smooth and easy, as if his  muscles flowed beneath his skin. The others had  all visibly whirled the rope, some of them even  shoulder high. I did not see his arm lift or move.  He appeared to hold the rope down low, by his  leg. But like a sudden snake I saw the noose go  out its length and fall true; and the thing was  done. As the captured pony walked in with a  sweet, church door expression, our train moved  slowly on to the station, and a passenger remarked,  " That man knows his business." 
thevirginian.txt	74	60.0	1902	Wister, Owen	The Virginian	" We don't want her along anyways, " the cowpuncher  had explained to me. " She runs around  mighty irresponsible, and she'll stand a prairie dog  'bout as often as she'll stand a bird. She's a triflin'  animal."  My anxiety to own the ducks caused me to pitch  into the water with all my clothes on, and subsequently  crawl out a slippery, triumphant, weltering  heap. The Virginian's serious eyes had rested  upon this spectacle of mud; but he expressed  nothing, as usual.  " They ain't overly good eatin', " he observed,  tying the birds to his saddle. " They'Re diverse."  " Diverse! " I exclaimed. " Why didn't they  dive?"  " I reckon they was young ones and hadn't experience."    " Well, " I said, crestfallen, but attempting to be  humorous, " I did the diving myself."  But the Virginian made no comment. He  handed me my double barrelled English gun,  which I was about to leave deserted on the ground  behind me, and we rode home in our usual silence,  EM'LY 71  the mean little white breasted, sharp billed diverse  dangling from his saddle.  It was in the bunk house that he took his revenge.  As I passed I heard his gentle voice  silently achieving some narrative to an attentive  audience, and just as I came by the open window  where he sat on his bed in shirt and drawers, his  back to me, I heard his concluding words, " And  the hat on his haid was the one mark showed yu'  he weien't a snappin' turtle." 
thevirginian.txt	77	180.0	1902	Wister, Owen	The Virginian	" Well, I don't believe she knows how. I think  she came near being a rooster."  " She's sure manly lookin', " said the Virginian.  We had walked toward the corral, and he was  now scrutinising Em'ly with interest.  She was an egregious fowl. She was huge and  gaunt, with great yellow beak, and she stood  straight and alert in the manner of responsible  people. There was something wrong with, her  tail. It slanted far to one side, one feather in it  twice as long as the rest. Feathers on her breast  there were none. These had been worn entirely  off by her habit of sitting upon potatoes and other  rough abnormal objects. And this lent to her  appearance an air of being decollete, singularly  at variance with her otherwise prudish ensemble.  Her eye was remarkably bright, but somehow it  had an outraged expression. It was as if she  went about the world perpetually scandalised over  the doings that fell beneath her notice. Her legs  were blue, long, and remarkably stout.  " She'D ought to wear knickerbockers, " murmured  the Virginian. " She'D look a heap better'n  some o' them college students. And she'll set on  potatoes, yu' say ? "  " She thinks she can hatch out anything. I'Ve  found her with onions, and last Tuesday I caught  her on two balls of soap."  In the afternoon the tall cow puncher and I rode  out to get an antelope. 
thevirginian.txt	163	10.0	1902	Wister, Owen	The Virginian	We trundled down the flopping, heavy eddied  Missouri to Plattsmouth, and there the" backed  us on to a siding, the Christian Endeavour being  expected to pass that way. And while the equality  absorbed themselves in a deep but harmless  game of poker by the side of the railway line, the  Virginian and I sat on the top of a car, contemplating  the sandy shallows of the Platte.  " I should think you'd take a hand, " said I.  " Poker ? With them kittens ? " One flash o{  the inner man lightened in his eyes and died  away, and he finished with his gentle drawl,  " When I play, I want it to be interestin'." He  took out Sir Walter's Kenilworth once more, and  turned the volume over and over slowly, without  opening it. You cannot tell if in spirit he  wandered on Bear Creek with the girl whose  book it was. The spirit will go one road, and  the thought another, and the body its own way  sometimes. " Queen Elizabeth would have played  a mighty powerful game, " was his next remark.  "Poker? "said I.  THE GAME AND THE NATION 155  " Yes, seh. Do you expaict Europe has got  any queen equal to her at present ? "  I doubted it.  tt Victoria'd get pretty nigh slain sliding chips  out agaynst Elizabeth.

thevirginian.txt	175	2.0	1902	Wister, Owen	The Virginian	We all listened a moment to the rejoicings  within.  " Energetic, ain't they ?" said the Southerner.  " But none of 'em was whelped savage enough to  sing himself bloodthirsty. And though they're  strainin' mighty earnest not to be tame, they're  goin' back to Sunk Creek with me accordin'  to the Judge's awdehs. Never a calf of them  will desert to Rawhide, for all their dangerousness;  nor I ain't goin' to have any fuss, over it.  Only one is left now that don't sing. Maybe I  will have to make some arrangements about him.  The man I have parted with, " he said, with another  glance at Dakota, " was our cook, and I will ask  yu' to replace him, Colonel."  Scipio gaped wide. " Colonel! Say!" He  stared at the Virginian. " Did I meet yu' at the  palace ? "  " Not exackly meet, " replied the Southerner.  " I was praisent one mawnin' las' month when  this gentleman awdehed frawgs' laigs."  THE GAME AND THE NATION 167  •  " Sakes and saints, but that was a mean position  ! " burst out Scipio. " I had to tell all comers  anything all day. Stand up and jump language  hot off my brain at 'em. And the pay don't near  compensate for the drain on the system. I don't  care how good a man is, you let him keep a tap  pin' his presence of mind right along, without  takin' a lay off, and you'll have him sick. Yes,  sir. You'Ll hit his nerves. So I told them they  could hire some fresh man, for I was goin' back  to punch cattle or fight Indians, or take a rest  somehow, for I didn't propose to get jaded, and  me only twenty-five years old.

" An antelope knows a snake is his enemy, "  said another to me. " Ever seen a buck circling  round and round a rattler ? "  " I have always wanted to see that, " said I,  heartily. For this I knew to be a respectable  piece of truth.  " It's worth seeing, " the man went on. " After  the buck gets close in, he gives an almighty jump  up in the air, and down comes his four hoofs in  a bunch right on top of Mr. Snake. Cuts him  all to hash. Now you tell me how the buck  knows that."  Of course I could not tell him. And again we  sat in silence for a while — friendlier silence, I  thought.  " A skunk'll kill yu' worse than a snake bite, "  said another, presently. " No, I don't mean that  way, " he added. For I had smiled. " There is  a brown skunk down in Arkansaw. Kind of  prairie dog brown. Littler than our variety, he  is. And he is mad the whole year round, same  as a dog gets. Only the dog has a spell and dies 5  but this here Arkansaw skunk is mad right along,  and it don't seem to interfere with his business  THE GAME AND THE NATION 177  in other respects. Well, suppose you're camping  out, and suppose it's a hot night, or you're in a  hurry, and you've made camp late, or anyway you  haven't got inside any tent, but you have just  bedded down in the open.

You get bit, that's all. 
thevirginian.txt	242	2.0	1902	Wister, Owen	The Virginian	Even upon the embarrassed Virginian a large  grin slowly forced itself. " I guess yu' know  about it, " he murmured. And he looked at me  with a sort of reproach. He knew it was I who  had told tales out of school.  " I only want to say, " said Ogden, conciliat  ingly, " that I know I couldn't have handled those  men."  The Virginian relented. "Yu' never tried,  seh."  The Judge had remained serious; but he  showed himself plainly more and more contented.  " Quite right, " he said. " You had to part with  your cook. When I put a man in charge, I put  S THE VIRGINIAN  him in charge. I don't make particulars my  business. They'Re to be always his. Do you  understand ?"  " Thank yu'." The Virginian understood that  his employer was praising his management of the  expedition. But I don't think he at all discerned  — as I did presently — that his employer had  just been putting him to a further test, had laid  before him the temptation of complaining of a  fellow workman and blowing his own trumpet,  and was delighted with his reticence. He made  a movement to rise.  " I haven't finished, " said the Judge. " I was  coming to the matter. There's one particular —  since I do happen to have been told. I fancy  Trampas has learned something he didn't expect."  This time the Virginian evidently did not  understand, any more than I did. One hand  played with his hat, mechanically turning it  round.

She was not sorry to have Georgie Taylor  come galloping along at this moment and join  them. But the Virginian swore profanely under his  breath. And on this ride nothing more happened.  XXIII  VARIOUS POINTS  LOVE had been snowbound for many weeks.  Before this imprisonment its course had run  neither smooth nor rough, so far as eye could  see; it had run either not at all, or, as an undercurrent,  deep out of sight. In their rides, in  their talks, love had been dumb, as to spoken  words at least; for the Virginian had set himself  a heavy task of silence and of patience. Then,  where winter barred his visits to Bear Creek, and  there was for the while no ranch work or responsibility  to fill his thoughts and blood with action,  he set himself a task much lighter. Often,  instead of Shakespeare and fiction, school books  lay open on his cabin table; and penmanship and  spelling helped the hours to pass. Many sheets  of paper did he fill with various exercises, and  Mrs. Henry gave him her assistance in advice  and corrections.  " I shall presently be in love with him myself, "  she told the Judge. " And it's time for you to  become anxious."  " I am perfectly safe, " he retorted. " There's  only one woman for him any more." 
thevirginian.txt	380	2.0	1902	Wister, Owen	The Virginian	His eye dwelled awhile on the fireplace, next on  the deer horns, and next it travelled toward the  shelf where her books were ; but it stopped before  reaching them.  " Better say off the names before I look, " said  he. " I'Ve had a heap o' misleading visions. And  — and supposin' — if this was just my sickness  fooling me some more — I'D want to die. I would  die! Now we'll see. If Copperfield is on the  floor " (he looked stealthily to be sure that it was),  " then she was readin' to me when everything happened,  and then there should be a hole in the  book row, top, left. Top, left, " he repeated, and  warily brought his glance to the place. " Proved! "  he cried. " It's all so ! "  He now noticed the miniature of Grandmother  Stark. " You are awful like her, " he whispered.  " You'Re cert'nly awful like her. May I kiss you  too, ma'am ?"  Then, tottering, he rose from his sick chair.  The Navajo blanket fell from his shoulders, and  gradually, experimentally, he stood upright. Helping  himself with his hand slowly along the wall  of the room, and round to the opposite wall with  many a pause, he reached the picture, and very  gently touched the forehead of the ancestral dame  with his lips. " I promise to make your little girl  happy, " he whispered. 
thevirginian.txt	423	2.0	1902	Wister, Owen	The Virginian	There was irony in his voice as he surveyed me, but  it fell away at once into sadness. " Both was miscreants.  But if Steve had played the coward, too,  it would have been a whole heap easier for me."  He paused before adding, " And Steve was not  a miscreant once."  His voice had trembled, and I felt the deep  emotion that seemed to gain upon him now that  394 THE VIRGINIAN  action was over and he had nothing to do but  think. And his view was simple enough: you  must die brave. Failure is a sort of treason to  the brotherhood, and forfeits pity. It was  Steve's perfect bearing that had caught his  heart so that he forgot even his scorn of the other  man.  But this was by no means all that was to come.  He harked back to that notion of a prisoner helping  to make it easy for his executioner. " Easy  plumb to the end, " he pursued, his mind reviewing  the acts of the morning. " Why, he tried to give  me your newspaper. I didn't — "  " Oh, no, " I said hastily. " I had finished with  it."  " Well, he took dying as naturally as he took  living. Like a man should. Like I hope to."  Again he looked at the pictures in his mind.  " No play acting nor last words. He just told  goodbye to the boys as we led his horse under the  limb — you needn't to look so dainty, " he broke  off. " You ain't going to get any more shocking  particulars." 
thevirginian.txt	479	1.0	1902	Wister, Owen	The Virginian	At the view of their journey's end, the Virginian  looked down at his girl beside him, his eyes  filled with a bridegroom's light, and, hanging safe  upon his breast, he could feel the gold ring that  he would slowly press upon her finger tomorrow.  He drew off the glove from her left hand, and  stooping, kissed the jewel in that other ring which  he had given her. The crimson fire in the opal  seemed to mingle with that in his heart, and his  arm lifted her during a moment from the saddle  as he held her to him. But in her heart the love  of him was troubled by that cold pang of loneliness  which had crept upon her like a tide as the  day drew near. None of her own people were  waiting in that distant town to see her become  his bride. Friendly faces she might pass on the  444  WITH MALICE AFORETHOUGHT 445  way; but all of them new friends, made in this  wild country: not a face of her childhood would  smile upon her; and deep within her, a voice cried  for the mother who was far away in Vermont.  That she would see Mrs. Taylor's kind face at  her wedding was no comfort now. 
thevirginian.txt	527	120.0	1902	Wister, Owen	The Virginian	And twice the stream that they followed went  into deep canons, so that for a while they parted  from it. When they came back to its margin for  the second time, he bade her notice how its water  had become at last wholly clear. To her it had  seemed clear enough all along, even in the plain  above the town. But now she saw that it flowed  lustrously with flashes; and she knew the soil had  changed to mountain soil. Lower down, the  water had carried the slightest cloud of alkali, and  this had dulled the keen edge of its transparence.  Full solitude was around them now, so that their  words grew scarce, and when they spoke it was  with low voices. They began to pass nooks and  AT DUNBARTON 487  points favourable for camping, with wood and water  at hand, and pasture for the horses. More than  once as they reached such places, she thought he  must surely stop; but still he rode on in advance  of her (for the trail was narrow) until, when she  was not thinking of it, he drew rein and pointed.  " What ? " she asked timidly.  " The pines, " he answered.  She looked, and saw the island, and the water  folding it with ripples and with smooth spaces.  The sun was throwing upon the pine boughs a  light of deepening red gold, and the shadow of  the fishing rock lay over a little bay of quiet water  and sandy shore. In this forerunning glow of the  sunset, the pasture spread like emerald; for the  dry touch of summer had not yet come near it. 
thevirginian.txt	543	2880.0	1902	Wister, Owen	The Virginian	And then the bride and groom went to see the  old great aunt over at Dunbarton.  Their first arrival, the one at Bennington, had  been thus: Sam Bell had met them at the train,  and Mrs. Wood, waiting in her parlour, had embraced  her daughter and received her son-in-law.  Among them they had managed to make the  occasion as completely mournful as any family  party can be, with the window blinds up. " And  with you present, my dear, " said Sam Bell to  Sarah, " the absence of a coffin was not felt."  But at Dunbarton the affair went off differently.  The heart of the ancient lady had taught her better  things. From Bennington to Dunbarton is  the good part of a day's journey, and they drove  up to the gate in the afternoon. The great aunt  was in her garden, picking some August flowers,  and she called as the carriage stopped, " Bring my  nephew here, my dear, before you go into the house."  At this, Molly, stepping out of the carriage,  squeezed her husband's hand. " I knew that she  would be lovely, " she whispered to him. And  then she ran to her aunt's arms, and let him follow.  He came slowly, hat in hand.  The old lady advanced to meet him, trembling  a little, and holding out her hand to him. " Welcome,  nephew, " she said. " What a tall fellow  you are, to be sure. Stand off, sir, and let me  look at you." 
thevirginian.txt	546	2628000.0	1902	Wister, Owen	The Virginian	The old lady gave much comfort and advice to  her niece in private, and when they came to leave,  she stood at the front door holding both their hands a moment.  "God bless you, my dears, " she told them.  "And when you come next time, I'll have the  nursery ready."  And so it happened that before she left this world, the great aunt was able to hold in her arms the first of their many children.  Judge Henry at Sunk Creek had his wedding present ready. His growing affairs in Wyoming needed his presence in many places distant from his ranch, and he made the Virginian his partner.  When the thieves prevailed at length, as they did, forcing cattle owners to leave the country or be ruined, the Virginian had forestalled this crash.

Then,  in 1892, came the cattle war, when, after putting  their men in office, and coming to own some  of the newspapers, the thieves brought ruin on  themselves as well. For in a broken country  there is nothing left to steal.  But the railroad came, and built a branch to that  land of the Virginian's where the coal was. By  that time he was an important man, with a strong  grip on many various enterprises, and able to give  his wife all and more than she asked or desired.  So THE VIRGINIAN  Sometimes she missed the Bear Creek days, when  she and he had ridden together, and sometimes  she declared that his work would kill him. But  it does not seem to have done so.

PowePA.txt	0	10080.0	1987	Powell, Padgett	A woman named Drown	SIX MONTHS AGO A friend of mine and I left doctoral programs in chemistry under certain different circumstances. Tom, a true scientist, got a letter at Oak Ridge, where he was finishing up his degree, informing him he had a job for the taking in Alabama—a high-level, nuclear police-chaperon affair, to judge from what he gleefully told me. I, scientist by default, by process of elimination, got a letter from my girlfriend in Norway letting me know in the subtlest, happiest way imaginable that I would not be joining her there as we had planned upon completion of my degree. When you are told that your fiancée, a promising post-doc to an internationally famous crystallographer expatriated from Brooklyn, finds that sagacious mentor “a cute little guy (only five three!)” who “eats eggs on his hamburgers!”—you can read all the handwriting on the wall you ever need to read. I called her up, twice (once, as the rhyme puts it, for the money—$300; and once for the show—a considerable theater of her releasing, in a two-hour transatlantic tear burst, from the gunny sack of our entire six years off-and-on together, every crime of impassion I committed, and these transgressions I admit were endless, ranging from birthdays forgotten to old lovers not forgotten), and got a picture, as you can only on a telephone costing you a month’s stipend, of her veritable sainthood for having put up for so long with the entire sham she convinced me I was, and was certain, as I reluctantly hung up the second time, that I had lost the finest, purest girl ever there would be for me. The starch in my doctorate will, which had not been much to begin with, vanished. 
PowePA.txt	1	20160.0	1987	Powell, Padgett	A woman named Drown	    I trudged around the lab more bowlegged or splayfooted toward purpose than usual for about two weeks, when I got a card from Tom in Alabama. Tom is the sort of natural scientist who can learn, say, Schrödinger, while penciling Walt Disney characters in the margins and filling their balloons with the integrals and derivatives required on the following day’s examination, and the first thing I saw on the card was a Goofyesque figure clearly representing Tom holding a Geiger counter to the rear end of an armadillo. Around the card this same figure pursued armadillos in odd attitudes and circumstances.    With a magnifying glass—Tom can put, he claims, four thousand words on a postcard—I made out this:     Remember Elaine? (Good girl.) I married her. Sold tent. Sold Mustang. It was a good car. Goofytom is doing what he does. Did you know armadillo feces register most accurately low-level hot traces around reactors? Me neither. P.U. Have my own desk. Partially stuffed mouse in drawer, lower left. Story behind that. Cotton sticking from his eyes makes him look like a ghoul mouse.     A badge and some ID papers have been found belonging to a certain … no! yes! … Fenster Ludge. Colleagues plenty Silkwood-worried. 
PowePA.txt	9	0.4998	1987	Powell, Padgett	A woman named Drown	  I wondered how I’d look with something like a little true mileage on me. I noticed for the first time what the Veteran really looked like: he was handsome. You couldn’t tell how many times his odometer might already have been around. He was not quite a bright, careful boy.    There was finally a bit of powerful logic in this dead-fucking-nigger thing, too. The rooms—all of them—did smell like piss, and the smell did seem to strengthen when you were away, and the Veteran’s puddle was perpetual, whereas my window, always open, never seemed to take in rain. And the Veteran had absolutely nothing in his room to steal except his cheap clock radio, which is the perfect inspiration for a petty thief to foul things. Standing there with him, I thought finally that his truest touch was in believing his tormentor dead: I half thought there might be something to it all whenever he said dead.    The only sense this makes is to see the scene and its effect on me as what we call an energy of activation in the long series of planless, purposeless goings-on that followed. I have been occupied since all the quitting began with people who are anything but custodians of their chances in life. 
PowePA.txt	35	2.5	1987	Powell, Padgett	A woman named Drown	  “Hey! Friggin idea! You gals go out there and mow some friggin parrot jungle down and the kid ’n me makes a round.”    Hoop rushed toward the bar, a substantial rattan-and-hardwood thing I hadn’t noticed, dusty in a corner of the patio. Virginia and Constance went out with a pair of shears.    “Would you look at the dust!” Hoop yelled. “Find me some swabbin gear, Chief.”    I went in the kitchen, made us two drinks, and returned with a rag and soap. “She’s been making them in there.”    “I know, for Christ sake. Broad’s got this bar from the islands, beautiful friggin teak here, won’t use it. We take it apart and hide it on board and get it here and get it back together—that’s the friggin miracle, and tight when we busted her up—no friggin numbers on it like your dinosaurs and shit.”    “Where was this?”    “Mutton fart capital of the world.”    “You were in the navy?”    “Guam, Guadalcanal, one of them G islands. No, Seabees. All them islands is alike. This bastard could’ve come from the halls of friggin Montezuma. What the shit difference. It’s heavy, pure-quill teak, we stole it from an operating whorehouse, we got it here is the thing. Contrabandits! Joke!”    Hoop threw the rag and soap bottle at the bar’s small chrome sink. “Whore called Five-ton sits on it, crying, see? Because Stump and me are having at it with screwdrivers, see?” He goes into falsetto. “ ‘I love you, Joes, no shit, Joes, but need post office for sell love.’ Five-ton whines this at us, see? Imagine that: some wiseheimy tells ’em a friggin whorehouse is a post office and they buy it. ‘You want first class, Joe?’ It was a scream. ‘You want special delivery?’ There Five-ton is, trying to hold the bar down, crying, and Stump and me start pulling it apart. Beautiful.” He is wiping the bar with great, broad strokes. I already feel drunk again. Hoop’s rag is steaming in vigorous circles on the teak. 
PowePA.txt	36	3.0	1987	Powell, Padgett	A woman named Drown	  “Doesn’t come over here that he don’t wash the friggin bar,” Mary is suddenly whispering in my ear. I have the sensation that some time has passed that I missed. Hoop is furiously twisting a dish towel inside a glass.    “It’s his past,” Mary says. She rolls her eyes. Virginia comes in with flowers, looking for a vase, her perfect teeth apologetically out front.    Hoop squeaks the rag in his glass and holds it to the light. “That’s a clean glass,” he says. “Something about a really clean glass, eh, Chief?”    Virginia passes through the room again, still looking for a vase.    I had the feeling that time was lurching and braking and bouncing me around within it. Ray Conniff and His Singers, for one thing, were suddenly very much with us, and I seemed to be swaying along with Mary to them.    “Always use your twist on these,” Hoop said, grinding a lemon rind around a glass rim. “People never follow their friggin recipes.”    I jumped because of breath in my ear. “How’s your clutch?” Mary said, inches from me.    “ ’Ere you go, Chief.” Hoop plunked three new drinks squarely on fresh cocktail napkins in front of us. “From the bar, where they ought to be,” he said proudly. Mary blew smoke at him and took a stool next to mine. She put a finger into the waistband of my putter pants. 
PowePA.txt	43	30240.0	1987	Powell, Padgett	A woman named Drown	  “Put your foot on the floor,” Mary said.    “It’s on the floor,” I said. “I know about that.”    “You know a lot,” she said. I couldn’t tell if she was mocking.    “What do you call the bedspins?” I asked.    “The whirlies.” I had thought maybe she had an exotic name from her own generation. She reached over and felt my forehead then, as if to say she had not meant to sound sarcastic if she had. I lay there spinning, thinking: She maybe thinks I know things, and maybe knows I don’t.            SO THAT IS HOW I find myself sitting at this wire-mesh table in the mornings, taking hangover notes, reflex motions of a would-have-been scientist. Since that first day three weeks ago we’ve not had anything so spectacular as the drop-in. Hoop and Virginia’s visit established several data points:      1. Sam, or Stump, is presumably dead, and that is the extent of my privileged knowledge.    2. He may have had something to do with Florida, where it is, as if in obeisance to Hoop’s outbursts, somehow tacitly assumed we may go, so long as it—the going—does not obtain an urgency. There is a sense in which we are packing our things psychologically, and when the moment is right, but not demanding or in any way special, we will take off and simply be there as unprepared and innocent as we were that night in the Car Wash. 
PowePA.txt	52	22.0	1987	Powell, Padgett	A woman named Drown	  Hazel stood up and kissed him, having to hold her glasses in place, and Bruce also had to restore his glasses high up onto his nose with his middle finger. He held them there while he bent down to a Styrofoam cooler on the floor and got two beers, then looked up at us and got two more, and Mary said, “We brought our own, thanks.”    “I’d give my eyeteeth,” Hazel said, “if I could still drink hard stuff.”    “Doctor told her it ’ud kill her,” Bruce said. Hazel kissed him again.    The girls went into old times, which were privately hilarious, while Bruce and I watched each other drink. After about twenty minutes, old times had become current events, and they had nothing currently in common except the visit, so Bruce and I were acknowledged. Hazel turned to him with yet another smacky kiss misaligning their eyeglasses. These kisses seemed designed and sufficient to make up for centuries of neglect. She held her lips to his cheek while he held his glasses in place.    “Do you know what this rascal did on our first date?” Hazel suddenly said. “He takes me to this bar outside town and says we’re going on to another one ten miles away, so I better go to the can.”    “Seven miles,” Bruce said. 
PowePA.txt	68	6.0	1987	Powell, Padgett	A woman named Drown	  “Bobby Cherry,” Tush-hog said, swinging his hand over our beers, and he tried to crush my hand, but wearing canary Ban-Lon got me ready for him, and he did not crush me. I toasted McCrae and the screech owls.    Mary got up, sailed over to us; Bobby Cherry stood up, I didn’t. “Handsome,” she said, “you ready to go?”    “Yes, ma’am,” I said. I stood up and tucked in my shirt. If there’s anything dorkier than a man wearing a yellow golf suit behind a filling station with a bunch of the boys in their jeans and pearl-button shirts, I suppose it’s a man wearing a yellow golf suit with the Ban-Lon shirt tucked in and the pants drawn up high showing a lot of sock. This was Mary’s method: she effected a little drama under the oak by charming the men and then leaving with the fruit she called handsome, and it was my job to look even more geeky to further tweak them. She had done something of the opposite with me in front of Hoop.    The car was still where Mary had slung it. She paid the man in the metal chair, fired up, and we were off in a cloud of rocks and pop tops. I picked up the playscript. 
PowePA.txt	71	30240.0	1987	Powell, Padgett	A woman named Drown	  A simple laid-back vs. square orientation? It seems better expressed somehow else, yet I will confess that the matter does in some senses appear to be one of terms like these. And it may be that the successful operators in this scattered mode are examples simply of lassitude and want of ambition. Still, I want to dignify the downward with another parameter: Are they capitalizing upon liabilities while the others are insisting on investing in assets only? Mary seems able to accept a loss with a victory; Friedeman surely paid for pausing in his career to ponder salvation and damnation; but my own old man preaches pure profit until blue in the face, and I have added to his congestion by simple indifference, which indifference registers for him as aggressive courting of another Depression. Perhaps it is indifference which the true fools lack. I cannot say. I will continue to record.            WE DID TOWNS. QUINCY, Panacea, Sopchoppy, Carrabelle, Blountstown—the best town names in the world. We even tried to take a tour of Chattahoochee, the largest state asylum. We’d try something like that and never think of something like Disney World. It became perfectly and agreeably clear that neither of us had any idea what to do. We watched folk who did have ideas. 
PowePA.txt	81	30.0	1987	Powell, Padgett	A woman named Drown	  “Al, make a check for two thousand. To yourself.”    I am writing today, not in the Mercury, but beside a plywood stand selling key-lime pies. I have eaten two slices of pie to justify writing on a picnic table beside the pie stand, but am drawing suspicious looks all the same. The girl in the stand has a tape player. We have just heard Freddie Fender sing of “wasted days and wasted nights.” Now Diana Ross of “no mountain high enough.”    We had taken the motel room, showered, and I sat down near the door. Mary sat on the bed, her arms on her knees, leaning toward me like a father. “There’s nothing personal in this,” she said.    “In what?”    “You can take the Merc or the two thousand.”    I looked at her, and the color TV, on a stand about eye level with me. I mulled this one over until I found myself playing with my lips and stopped.    “I understand,” I said. What was odd was that I believe I did understand. She was closing a very successful road show and meant for us, as actors, to move on. And she was clever enough to fold following a packed-house night rather than when the play was in trouble.    “What about Stump’s wardrobe?” I said. 
PowePA.txt	96	3.0	1987	Powell, Padgett	A woman named Drown	  “Say whut?”    The bus has taken an unexpected stop—for a flat, being attended to now by a Montgomery Ward truck—in Panacea. I enter Eastside Beverage. A white man is saying to a black named Augusta (from his work-shirt embroidery), “He is a nice snake.” Augusta says, “Don’t start on me that shit.” “I’ll show you,” the proprietor says, heading for the back. Augusta gets off his stool, ready to run, full of mock fear and a little true fear.    The proprietor returns with a cigar box, opens it: a boxful of snapshots.    “Oh,” Augusta says. “All right.”    In a photo the white man holds a large diamond-back in one smooth loop between its head and tail. The mouth is open, slack. “We enjoyed each other,” the proprietor says. Augusta looks at him with quick, hard, mock disapproval and some real disapproval. Apparently the proprietor is seeking to have Augusta believe the snake was alive and his pet.    “That’s a dead snake,” I say.    “Yeah, he died.”    “No, he’s dead right there.”    The proprietor does some sizing up of me. I get two quarts of beer I do not want, to remain casual and fluid.    “That snake was dead before you ever got near it.”    Augusta studies the picture.    “These two quarts of beer are for Augusta, a man who knows bullshit.”    Augusta says, “That I do.” He looks at the proprietor in a way designed, however, to let him know he thinks I’m crazy. 
PowePA.txt	98	5.0	1987	Powell, Padgett	A woman named Drown	  “I take it that’s important, still. The word.”    “Damn straight.”    “And you’re that kind.”    “Damn straight.”    “Good.”    Bobby Cherry’s getting concerned. “Why is it good?” he says.    “I want you to be the kind of guy you say you are.”    “You don’t think I am?”    “Didn’t say that.”    “I better get in my truck before I do something I regret.”    “Get in your truck.”    He does. Easy as that.    In a dime store in Milton, Florida, I tell the clerk, “I don’t think I’m a Communist.”    She passes my items past her: a balsa glider in a flat pack, tube socks, a tin box of split shot.    “I know you’re not a Communist,” she says. “I wish it would rain.”    “Yes, ma’am. I know you do. It’s a shame we undid the Indians,” I say. “They had those rain dances. Marched about a million of them right by here on the way to Oklahoma, too.”    “Nope,” she says, sacking my airplane, socks, shot.    “No?”    “Trucked ’em. Wouldn’t let ’em touch the ground.”    “Shame.”    “Pity.”    “We are bad.”    She looks at me. I am testing her now.    “We are bad,” I say again. “You have hundreds of rubber buffalo and Indians in here for sale.” Perhaps she will think I’m a Communist, after all. 
PowePA.txt	121	30.0	1987	Powell, Padgett	A woman named Drown	  I walk the tennis court, cracking acorns on the deep green composition surface made nearly black by the shadows of the oaks. In the early morning, hours before my father takes my mother to the beauty parlor, but only a bit sooner than she begins to pester him to do so, two black men about fifty years old, whom my father without malice calls The Boys, will arrive to rake the yard. I wish The Boys would sweep the courts as well, sweep these acorns going off like firecrackers out here at three in the morning. I pop, I skid, I skate. I lose track of time, I think—perhaps out of drinking shape without Mary—because it is suddenly dawning and I see The Boys arrive and set up to rake, nearly invisible in their green uniforms in the fog, talking as low and gently as if they were fishing.    As a child I thought The Boys were a constant two men and only now realize that they change over rapidly, supplied by a lawn service with access to an apparently inexhaustible supply of quiet, early-rising blacks. To my father I believe they are a constant team—The Boys. 
PowePA.txt	126	120960.0	1987	Powell, Padgett	A woman named Drown	   Muhv—     Garden restored. Miss you more than like. Got sillymental in Fla. (about Stump—don’t tell Hoop) and messed up. Give call. Tunkie Friedeman gave address. Says he knows you’ll be back in the sun soon, ha ha. Said to tell you that. ? Drop by? Love—        Friedeman? What in the world was going on? Tunkie Friedeman? Conspiracy theory entered my mind. This was no damned Brownian powder-blown drift. I felt like Mia Farrow in Rosemary’s Baby.    Then again, was it only that Mary and Friedeman knew each other and somehow discovered—did I tell Mary I worked for a Friedeman and she held her no-bio tongue? Yes. I told her I worked for a nut. She smiled. She knew him. But how did she know I’d come home? She didn’t. Chanced it. A small endothermic bonding 238 bondings down the thousandfold series that was evolving me unto some end.    I recalled an early chemistry professor I had who seemed to have relied entirely upon his sense of smell in achieving his considerable academic station. On emeritus status, he was employed to interest freshmen in the magic of chemistry—almost the alchemy of chemistry—its colors, its aromatic delights, even its poetry. His chemistry was numberless, headache-free, earthy, approximate, elegant—a chemistry that seduced worried freshmen. You may call dicopper oxide, he’d say, cuprous oxide, and copper oxide, cupric. You may, as the English do, refer to al-you-minium. Bleach is sodium hypohalite. He’d waft a tube to his Old World nose, hold it to the light—glacial acetic acid (you may call it condensed vinegar), or another tube, product of a spuming reaction—sniff—why, it’s old methyl ethyl ketone. What’s that brown stuff in there? Some suspicious student would ask. That, the emeritus Nose Chemist would say, that is nothing, some trash. 
PowePA.txt	142	5.0	1987	Powell, Padgett	A woman named Drown	  Minnie smoking on the parapet, the Pacifist sitting on the roof with his head not a foot from her lap, Earl becalmed into a swaying surveillance of his car, I shaped the gravel around the wine. We looked like a guerrilla camp.    And so what is it, the older-women thing, that put the Pacifist and me into our revolts? Discovery of discoveries, looking at Minnie as I am, it comes to me: they have adjusted anti-actualization quotients like the blacks have. Thus, Minnie doubly is the queen bee that she is in this universe of practiced loss.    Mary was like a ball glove handed to you in the seventh inning, used by someone else during the critical innings, and you get to play when the game is nearly won or lost with a trained glove that promises to be error-free. She was frayed, she was wrinkled, she had a cotton-candy softness, but all in all, she was a package of reticence and careless ease so correctly balanced I had never been so attracted to a person in my life.    “Sheeeeeit,” the Pacifist suddenly said, going into a fit again. Minnie grabbed his hair and shook it gently and let go; the Pacifist looked up, around, to see what the pressure had been. I was pouring her another wine and he did not know she had touched him. 
PowePA.txt	143	40320.0	1987	Powell, Padgett	A woman named Drown	  Things were, at this moment, clear and not clear to me. Overall, I had taken a little downside sabbatical that had shown me something I would find it best to know only as the Nose Chemist knew his ketones: with Havana Carlisle in the back of my mind, I could inherit a two million net deal with enough grace that I would not worry about acquiring a $400 River Road plate, not haze a yardman—not much more, finally, was certain. Havana kept appearing to me: instead of cigar-waving down the main street of his town in Missouri, he was waving his cigar across my crushed-shell trucking lot. He was telling the company: Let’s raise our anti-actualization quotients to comfortable levels and go on about our business with these pipes.    The world seemed a place of improbable wild hope. I told my father I will run his business—my business—and all I see, all I can hold probable about that, is gathering these fools together and seeing how far we can go on two million dollars. Bonaparte washes trucks, whistling shrilly all the live-long day, and drives. Wallace dispatches trucks by heaving darts into the territory board. The Veteran watches the grounds at night. My bus driver takes a load of oil pipe, and another, here, and there, and never has to return. When I get ambitious, I’ll have Tunkie Friedeman come down and formulate a revolutionary synthetic that will set the pace for the next generation of pipe.    And Mary. I resolve, in the morning, to drop by. One does not, when calling on Mary, need pause to buy flowers.
GrisJR.txt	0	15.0	1996	Grisham, John	The runaway jury	    One      The face of Nicholas Easter was slightly hidden by a display rack filled with slim cordless phones, and he was looking not directly at the hidden camera but somewhere off to the left, perhaps at a customer, or perhaps at a counter where a group of kids hovered over the latest electronic games from Asia. Though taken from a distance of forty yards by a man dodging rather heavy mall foot traffic, the photo was clear and revealed a nice face, clean-shaven with strong features and boyish good looks. Easter was twenty-seven, they knew that for a fact. No eyeglasses. No nose ring or weird haircut. Nothing to indicate he was one of the usual computer nerds who worked in the store at five bucks an hour. His questionnaire said he’d been there for four months, said also that he was a part-time student, though no record of enrollment had been found at any college within three hundred miles. He was lying about this, they were certain.    He had to be lying. Their intelligence was too good. If the kid was a student, they’d know where, for how long, what field of study, how good were the grades, or how bad. They’d know. He was a clerk in a Computer Hut in a mall. Nothing more or less. Maybe he planned to enroll somewhere. Maybe he’d dropped out but still liked the notion of referring to himself as a part-time student. Maybe it made him feel better, gave him a sense of purpose, sounded good. 
GrisJR.txt	1	15.0	1996	Grisham, John	The runaway jury	  But he was not, at this moment nor at any time in the recent past, a student of any sort. So, could he be trusted? This had been thrashed about the room twice already, each time they came to Easter’s name on the master list and his face hit the screen. It was a harmless lie, they’d almost decided.    He didn’t smoke. The store had a strict nonsmoking rule, but he’d been seen (not photographed) eating a taco in the Food Garden with a co-worker who smoked two cigarettes with her lemonade. Easter didn’t seem to mind the smoke. At least he wasn’t an antismoking zealot.    The face in the photo was lean and tanned and smiling slightly with lips closed. The white shirt under the red store jacket had a buttonless collar and a tasteful striped tie. He appeared neat, in shape, and the man who took the photo actually spoke with Nicholas as he pretended to shop for an obsolete gadget; said he was articulate, helpful, knowledgeable, a nice young man. His name badge labeled Easter as a Co-Manager, but two others with the same title were spotted in the store at the same time. 
GrisJR.txt	7	5.0	1996	Grisham, John	The runaway jury	  Carl ran through the photos of the Wilkeses’ home, a massive suburban trilevel with Doctor stamped all over it. He spent little time with these, saving the best for last. Then there was Traci, once again soaked with sweat, her designer bike nearby on the grass, sitting under a tree in a park, far away from everyone, half-hidden and—smoking a cigarette!    The same photographer grinned stupidly. It was his finest work, this hundred-yard shot of the doctor’s wife sneaking a cigarette. He had had no idea she smoked, just happened to be nonchalantly smoking himself near a footbridge when she dashed by. He loitered about the park for half an hour until he saw her stop and reach into the pouch on her bike.    The mood around the room lightened for a fleeting moment as they looked at Traci by the tree. Then Carl said, “Safe to say that we’ll take number fifty-seven.” He made a notation on a sheet of paper, then took a sip of old coffee from a paper cup. Of course he’d take Traci Wilkes! Who wouldn’t want a doctor’s wife on the jury when the plaintiff’s lawyers were asking for millions? Carl wanted nothing but doctors’ wives, but he wouldn’t get them. The fact that she enjoyed cigarettes was simply a small bonus. 
GrisJR.txt	48	2.0	1996	Grisham, John	The runaway jury	  “You were on a civil jury a few years back, I believe,” Rohr said warmly.    “Yes,” she said, clearing her throat and trying to be loud.    “What kind of case was it?” he asked, though he knew virtually every detail—seven years ago, this very courtroom, different judge, zero for the plaintiff. The file had been copied weeks ago. Rohr had even talked to the plaintiff’s lawyer, a friend of his. He started with this question and this juror because it was an easy warm-up, a soft pitch to show the others how painless it was to raise one’s hand and discuss matters.    “A car wreck case,” she said.    “Where was the trial?” he asked sincerely.    “Right here.”    “Oh, in this courtroom.” He sounded quite surprised, but the defense lawyers knew he was faking.    “Did the jury reach a verdict in that case?”    “Yes.”    “And what was that verdict?”    “We didn’t give him anything.”    “Him being the plaintiff?”    “Yes. We didn’t think he was really hurt.”    “I see. Was this jury service a pleasant experience for you?”    She thought a moment, then, “It was okay. Lot of wasted time, though, you know, when the lawyers were wrangling about this or that.”    A big smile. “Yes, we tend to do that. Nothing about that case would influence your ability to hear this one?”    “No, don’t think so.”    “Thank you, Mrs. Millwood.” Her husband was once an accountant for a small county hospital that was forced to close after being nailed in a medical malpractice case. Large verdicts were something she secretly loathed, and for good reason. Jonathan Kotlack, the plaintiff’s lawyer in charge of final jury selection, had long since removed her name from consideration. 
GrisJR.txt	103	180.0	1996	Grisham, John	The runaway jury	  Jerry Fernandez had already nicknamed him Napoleon. Nap for short. The Retarded Colonel as an alternative.    “There were no complaints yesterday,” Nicholas shot back.    “Let’s eat. I’m starving,” Herrera said, unwrapping a sandwich. A few of the others did the same.    The aroma of baked chicken and french fries rose from the table. As Mr. O’Reilly finished unpacking a container of pasta salad, he said, “I’ll be happy to bring over some plates and forks on Monday. No problem.”    Nicholas quietly said, “Thanks,” and sat down.      THE DEAL was an easy one to make. The details were wrapped up between two old friends over a three-hour lunch at the ‘21’ Club on Fifty-second. Luther Vandemeer, CEO of Trellco, and his former protégé, Larry Zell, now CEO of Listing Foods, had discussed the basics on the phone, but needed to meet face-to-face over food and wine so no one could hear them. Vandemeer gave him the background of the latest serious threat down in Biloxi, and didn’t hide the truth that he was worried. Sure, Trellco was not a named defendant, but the entire industry was under fire and the Big Four was standing firm. Zell knew this. He’d worked for Trellco for seventeen years, and had learned to hate trial lawyers a long time ago. 
GrisJR.txt	142	60.0	1996	Grisham, John	The runaway jury	  Nicholas took a seat at the table and began discussing strategy with Herman. It was not fair to keep them locked up during delays such as this, and Nicholas was of the opinion that they should be allowed to leave the building, with escorts, and engage in morning walks, as opposed to those of the noontime variety. It was agreed that Nicholas should put this request in writing, as usual, and present it to Judge Harkin during the noon recess.      AT TEN-THIRTY, they finally walked into the courtroom, the air still heavy with the heat of battle, and the first person Nicholas saw was the man who’d broken into his apartment. He was out there on the third row, plaintiff’s side, in a shirt and tie with a newspaper spread before him and resting on the back of the pew in front. He was alone, and he barely looked at the jurors as they took their seats. Nicholas didn’t stare; two long glances and the identification was complete.    For all of his guile and cunning, Fitch could do some stupid things. And sending this goon into the courtroom was a risky move with little potential benefit. What was he supposed to see or hear that would not be seen or heard by one of the dozen lawyers, or half-dozen jury consultants, or handful of other flunkies Fitch kept in the courtroom? 
GrisJR.txt	191	1.6	1996	Grisham, John	The runaway jury	  “Now, I have two choices. I can declare a mistrial, or I can sequester the jury. I’m inclined to pursue the latter, as distasteful as it will be. Mr. Rohr?”    Rohr was slow to rise, and for a rare moment could think of little to say. “Uh, gee, Judge, we’d sure hate to see a mistrial. I mean, I’m certain that we’ve done nothing wrong.” He glanced at the defense table as he said this. “Someone broke in on a juror?” he asked.    “That’s what I said. I’ll show you the proof in a moment. Mr. Cable?”    Sir Durr stood and buttoned his jacket right properly. “This is quite shocking, Your Honor.”    “Certainly is.”    “I’m really in no position to respond until I hear more,” he said, returning the look of utter suspicion to the lawyers who were obviously guilty, the plaintiff’s.    “Very well. Bring in juror number four, Stella Hulic,” His Honor instructed Willis. Stella was stiff with fear and already pale by the time she reentered the courtroom.    “Please take a seat in the witness stand, Mrs. Hulic. This won’t take but a minute.” The Judge smiled with great assurance and waved at the chair in the witness box. Stella shot wild looks in all directions as she sat down. 
GrisJR.txt	210	2.0	1996	Grisham, John	The runaway jury	  Harkin made the mistake of glancing over his shoulder at Rohr, who couldn’t wait to add a few thoughts. “Oh hell, Judge, what’s the big deal?” he blurted. “These folks aren’t carrying plastic explosives.”    “That’s enough,” Harkin said, but Rohr had managed to curry a slight favor with the jury. Cable, of course, felt the same, and wanted to convey his heartfelt trust in whatever the jurors had packed in their American Touristers, but Harkin didn’t give him the chance.    “Very well,” His Honor said. “The bags will not be searched. But if it comes to my attention that any juror possesses any item prohibited by the list I handed out yesterday, then that juror will be in contempt of court and subject to being jailed. Do we understand?”    Easter looked around the room, took the measure of each of his fellow jurors, most of whom appeared relieved and a few of whom were actually nodding. “That’s fine, Judge,” he said.    “Good. Now can we get on with the trial?”    “Well, there’s one other problem.”    “What is it?”    Nicholas lifted a sheet of paper from the table, read something, then said, “According to your rules here, we’re allowed one conjugal visit per week. We think we should get more.”    “How many?”    “As many as possible.”    This was news to most of the jurors. There had been some grumbling among some of the men, Easter and Fernandez and Lonnie Shaver in particular, about the number of conjugal visits, but the women had not discussed it.
GrisJR.txt	265	30.0	1996	Grisham, John	The runaway jury	  “Your fingers are on the pulse here. We’re obviously outsiders, so we’ll rely on you. Let me give you a scenario. You tell me if it’ll work. What if you meet with Mr. Moke, just the two of you, and you tell him in broad strokes about the development? Our names are not mentioned, you simply have this client who wants to work with him. He’ll name his price. If it’s within our range, then you tell him it’s a deal. We’ll take care of the delivery, and you never know for certain if the cash actually changes hands. You’ve done nothing wrong. He’s happy. We’re happy because we’re about to make a pot full of money, along with you, I might add.”    Hoppy liked it! None of the mud could stick to his hands. Let his client and Jimmy Hull do their dirty work. He’d stay out of the gutter and simply turn his head. Still, he was overcome by caution. He said he’d like to think about it.    They chatted some more, looked at the plans once again, and said good-bye at eight. Ringwald was to call early Friday morning.    Before heading home, Hoppy dialed the number on Ringwald’s business card. An efficient receptionist in Las Vegas said, “Good afternoon, KLX Property Group.” Hoppy smiled, then asked to speak to Todd Ringwald. The call was routed, with soft rock in the background, to Mr. Ringwald’s office where Hoppy spoke to Madeline, an assistant of some variety who explained that Mr. Ringwald was out of town and not expected back until Monday. She asked who was calling, and Hoppy quickly hung up. 
GrisJR.txt	288	300.0	1996	Grisham, John	The runaway jury	  “You. He knows you’re loose on the streets scheming up all sorts of ways to get to the jury. Wouldn’t you be worried, Fitch, if some guy like you was hard at work for the plaintiff?”    “I’d be terrified.”    “Rohr isn’t terrified. He’s just worried.”    “How often do you talk to him?”    “A lot. He’s sweeter than you, Fitch. He’s a very pleasant man to talk to, plus he doesn’t record my calls, doesn’t send in goons to follow my car. None of that sort of stuff.”    “Really knows how to charm a girl, huh?”    “Yeah. But he’s weak where it counts.”    “Where’s that?”    “In the wallet. He can’t match your resources.”    “How much of my resources do you want?”    “Later, Fitch. Gotta run. There’s a suspicious-looking car sitting across the street. Must be some of your clowns.” She hung up.    Fitch showered and tried to sleep. At 2 A.M., he drove himself to the Lucy Luck, where he played blackjack at five hundred dollars a hand, sipped Sprite until dawn, when he left with close to twenty thousand dollars in fresh winnings.            Twenty      The first Saturday in November arrived with temperatures in the low sixties, unseasonably cool for the Coast and its near-tropical climate. A gentle breeze from the north rattled trees and scattered leaves on the streets and sidewalks. Fall usually arrived late and lasted until the first of the year, when it yielded to spring. The Coast did not experience winter. 
GrisJR.txt	376	600.0	1996	Grisham, John	The runaway jury	  Derrick rolled over and fell fast asleep.    They awoke at dawn, and Angel panicked because she had a man in her room and this was, of course, against the Judge’s orders. Derrick was unconcerned. He said he’d simply wait until they left for court, then sneak out of the room. This did little to calm her nerves. Angel took a long shower.    Derrick had taken Cleve’s plan and improved on it immensely. After leaving the tavern, he bought a six-pack and drove along the Gulf for hours. Slowly, up and down Highway 90, past the hotels and casinos and boat docks, from Pass Christian to Pascagoula he had driven, sipping beer and expanding the scheme. Cleve, after a few drinks, had let it slip that the lawyers for the plaintiff were seeking millions. It took only nine of the twelve for a verdict, so Derrick figured Angel’s vote was worth a helluva lot more than ten thousand dollars.    Ten thousand sounded great at the tavern, but if they would pay that much, and agree to do it so quickly, then they would pay more with pressure. The more he drove, the more her vote was worth. It was now at fifty, and rising almost by the hour. 
GrisJR.txt	391	1440.0	1996	Grisham, John	The runaway jury	  But just one to settle his nerves, to help forget this miserable day.    “You okay, boss?” José asked.    Fitch grunted something, and stopped thinking about beer. Where was Marlee, and why hadn’t she called today? The trial was winding down. A deal would take time to negotiate and execute.    He thought of the column in Mogul, and he longed for Marlee. He heard Jankle’s idiotic voice expounding a brand-new defense theory, and he longed for Marlee. He closed his eyes and saw the faces of the jurors, and he longed for Marlee.      SINCE DERRICK now considered himself to be a major player, he chose a new meeting place for Wednesday night. It was a rough bar in the black section of Biloxi, a place Cleve had actually been before. Derrick figured he’d have the upper hand if the rendezvous occurred on his turf. Cleve insisted they meet in the parking lot first.    The lot was almost filled. Cleve was late. Derrick spotted him when he parked, and walked to the driver’s side.    “I don’t think this is a good idea,” Cleve said, peeking through the crack in his window and looking at the dark, cinder-block building with steel rods across the windows. 
GrisJR.txt	522	60.0	1996	Grisham, John	The runaway jury	  Short of burning the courthouse or tossing grenades at the jury room, there was nothing he could do to stop the deliberations. They were in there, the last twelve, with deputies by the door. Perhaps if their work was slow, and if they had to retire for another night in sequestration, then perhaps Fitch could pull a rabbit from his hat and spark a mistrial.    A bomb threat was a possibility. The jurors would be evacuated, sequestered some more, led away to some hidden place so they could continue.    The flow chart fizzled and he made lists of possibilities—outrageous acts, all of which would be dangerous, illegal, and destined for failure.    The clock was ticking.    The chosen twelve—eleven disciples and their master.    He slowly rose to his feet and took the cheap ceramic lamp with both hands. It was a lamp Konrad had earlier wanted to remove because it sat on Fitch’s desk, a place of great chaos and violence.    Konrad and Pang were loitering in the hallway, waiting for instructions. They knew something had gone terribly wrong. The lamp crashed with great force against the door. Fitch screamed. The plywood walls rattled. Another object hit and splintered; maybe it was a telephone. Fitch yelled something about “the money!” and then the desk landed loudly against a wall.    They backed away, petrified and not wanting to be near the door when it opened. Bam! Bam! Bam! It sounded like a jackhammer. Fitch was punching the plywood with his fists. 
GrisJR.txt	539	12.0	1996	Grisham, John	The runaway jury	  There was a long pause; the only sound came from Lonnie snipping his fingernails.    Finally, Nicholas said, “Who cannot vote to return any damages whatsoever?”    Savelle raised his hand. Lonnie ignored the question, but then he didn’t need to respond.    “The vote stands at ten to two,” Nicholas reported, and wrote this down. “This jury has hereby reached its decision on liability. Now, let’s settle the issue of damages. Can the ten of us agree that the Wood estate is entitled to the two million in actual damages?    Savelle kicked his chair back and left the room. Lonnie poured a cup of coffee and sat by the window, his back to the group, but listening to every word.    The two million sounded like pocket change in light of the previous discussion, and it was approved by the ten. Nicholas wrote this on a form approved by Judge Harkin.    “Can the ten of us agree that punitive damages should be imposed, in some amount?” He slowly went around the table and got a “Yes” from each. Mrs. Gladys Card hesitated. She could change her mind, but it would have no impact. Only nine votes were needed for a verdict.    “All right. Now, as to the amount of punitive damages. Any ideas?”    “I have one,” Jerry said. “Get everybody to write their amount on a piece of paper, fold it, keep it secret, then add them up and divide by ten. That way we’ll see what the average is.”    “Will it be binding?” Nicholas asked. 
GrisJR.txt	559	2.0	1996	Grisham, John	The runaway jury	I never planned to keep the money. I just wanted to borrow it.”    “If you’re gonna lie and cheat, why not go ahead and steal?”    “I’m not a thief. I lied and I cheated because that’s what your client understands. Tell me, Fitch, did you find Gabrielle?”    “Yes, we did.”    “And did you find her parents?”    “We know where they are.”    “Do you understand now, Fitch?”    “It makes more sense, yes.”    “They were both wonderful people. They were intelligent and vigorous and they loved life. They both got hooked on cigarettes when they were in college, and I watched them fight the habit until they died. They hated themselves for smoking, but could never give it up. They died horrible deaths, Fitch. I watched them suffer and shrivel and gasp for breath until they couldn’t breathe anymore. I was their only child, Fitch. Did your goons learn this?”    “Yes.”    “My mother died at home, on the sofa in the den because she couldn’t walk to her bedroom. Just Mother and I.” She paused and glanced around. Fitch noticed her eyes were remarkably clear. Sad as it must have been, he could muster no sympathy.    “When did you set this plan in motion?” he asked, finally taking a spoonful of soup. 
GrisJR.txt	560	1.1	1996	Grisham, John	The runaway jury	  “Grad school. I studied finance, thought about law, then I dated a lawyer for a while and heard stories of tobacco litigation. The idea evolved.”    “A helluva plot.”    “Thanks, Fitch. Coming from you, that’s a compliment.”    She pulled her gloves tighter as if she was ready to go. “Just wanted to say hello, Fitch. And to make sure you know why it happened.”    “Are you finished with us?”    “No. We’ll watch the appeal closely, and if your lawyers get too carried away attacking the verdict, then I’ve got copies of the wire transfers. Be careful, Fitch. We’re kind of proud of that verdict, and we’re always watching.”    She stood at the edge of the table. “And remember, Fitch, next time you boys go to trial, we’ll be there.”       
AuelJM.txt	0	4.0	1985	Auel, Jean M	The Mammoth Hunters	1      Trembling with fear, Ayla clung to the tall man beside her as she watched the strangers approach. Jondalar put his arm around her protectively, but she still shook.    He’s so big! Ayla thought, gaping at the man in the lead, the one with hair and beard the color of fire. She had never seen anyone so big. He even made Jondalar seem small, though the man who held her towered over most men. The red-haired man coming toward them was more than tall; he was huge, a bear of a man. His neck bulged, his chest could have filled out two ordinary men, his massive biceps matched most men’s thighs.    Ayla glanced at Jondalar and saw no fear in his face, but his smile was guarded. They were strangers, and in his long travels he had learned to be wary of strangers.    “I don’t recall seeing you before,” the big man said without preamble. “What Camp are you from?” He did not speak Jondalar’s language, Ayla noticed, but one of the others he had been teaching her.    “No Camp,” Jondalar said. “We are not Mamutoi.” He unclasped Ayla and took a step forward, holding out both hands, palms upward showing he was hiding nothing, in the greeting of friendliness. “I am Jondalar of the Zelandonii.”    The hands were not accepted. “Zelandonii? That’s a strange … Wait, weren’t there two foreign men staying with those river people that live to the west? It seems to me the name I heard was something like that.”    “Yes, my brother and I lived with them,” Jondalar conceded. 
AuelJM.txt	1	1.0	1985	Auel, Jean M	The Mammoth Hunters	  The man with the flaming beard looked thoughtful for a while, then, unexpectedly, he lunged for Jondalar and grabbed the tall blond man in a bone-crunching bear hug.    “Then we are related!” he boomed, a broad smile warming his face. “Tholie is the daughter of my cousin!”    Jondalar’s smile returned, a little shaken. “Tholie! A Mamutoi woman named Tholie was my brother’s cross-mate! She taught me your language.”    “Of course! I told you. We are related.” He grasped the hands that Jondalar had extended in friendship, which he had rejected before. “I am Talut, headman of the Lion Camp.”    Everyone was smiling, Ayla noticed. Talut beamed a grin at her, then eyed her appreciatively. “I see you are not traveling with a brother now,” he said to Jondalar.    Jondalar put his arm around her again, and she noticed a fleeting look of pain wrinkle his brow before he spoke. “This is Ayla.”    “It’s an unusual name. Is she of the river people?”    Jondalar was taken aback by the abruptness of his questioning, then, remembering Tholie, he smiled inwardly. The short, stocky woman he knew bore little resemblance to the great hulk of a man standing there on the riverbank, but they were chipped from the same flint. They both had the same direct approach, the same unself-conscious—almost ingenuous—candor. He didn’t know what to say. Ayla was not going to be easy to explain. 
AuelJM.txt	69	2.0	1985	Auel, Jean M	The Mammoth Hunters	  “When she agreed to join with me, I decided to stay there with her I always had an interest in working stone, even as a youngster, and I learned their way of making spear points. They chip off both sides of the stone, you understand?” He directed the question to Jondalar.    “Yes, bifacially, like an axe.”    “But these points were not so thick and crude. They had good technique. I showed them some things, too, and I was quite content to accept their ways, especially after the Mother blessed her with a child, a boy. She asked me for a name, as was their custom. I chose Ranec.”    That explains it, Ayla thought. His mother was dark-skinned.    “What made you decide to come back?” Jondalar asked.    “A few years after Ranec was born, difficulties began. The dark-skinned people I was living with had moved there from farther south, and some people from neighboring Camps didn’t want to share hunting grounds. There were differences in customs. I almost convinced them to meet and talk about it. Then some young hotheads from both sides decided to fight about it instead. One death led to another for revenge, and then to attacks on home Camps. 
AuelJM.txt	81	5.0	1985	Auel, Jean M	The Mammoth Hunters	  Ayla was in a turmoil, conflicting emotions pulling at her. These were the Others she had looked for. The kind she had been born to. She would have grown up with people like them, comfortable, at home, if it hadn’t been for the earthquake. Instead she had been raised by the Clan. She knew Clan customs, but the ways of her own people were strange. Yet if it hadn’t been for the Clan, she wouldn’t have grown up at all. She couldn’t go back to them, but she didn’t feel that she belonged here, either.    These people were so noisy, and disorderly. Iza would have said they had no manners. Like that Frebec man, speaking out of turn, without asking permission, and then everyone yelling and talking at once. She thought Talut was a leader, but even he had to shout to make himself heard. Brun would never have had to shout. The only time she ever heard him shout was to warn someone of impending danger. Everyone in the clan kept the leader at a certain level of awareness; Brun had only to signal, and within heartbeats, he would have had everyone’s attention.    She didn’t like the way these people talked about the Clan, either, calling them flatheads and animals. Couldn’t anyone see they were people, too? A little different, maybe, but people just the same. Nezzie knew it. In spite of what the rest said, she knew Rydag’s mother was a woman, and the child to whom she gave birth only a baby. He’s mixed, though, like my son, Ayla thought, and like Oda’s little girl at the Clan Gathering. How could Rydag’s mother have had a child of mixed spirits like that? 
AuelJM.txt	153	1.0	1985	Auel, Jean M	The Mammoth Hunters	  “Couldn’t someone go with her?” Jondalar suggested. “The horse can take two. I’ve ridden double with her.”    Talut was smiling again. “That’s a good idea! Who wants to go?”    “I’ll go! I know the way,” a voice called out, followed quickly by a second. “I know the way. I just came from there.” Latie and Danug had both spoken up, and several others looked ready to.    Talut looked from one to the other, then shrugged his shoulders, holding out both hands, and turned to Ayla. “The choice is yours.”    Ayla looked at the youth, nearly as tall as Jondalar, with red hair the color of Talut’s, and the pale fuzz of a beginning beard. Then at the tall, thin girl, not quite a woman but getting close, with dark blond hair a shade or two lighter than Nezzie’s. There was earnest hope in both sets of eyes. She didn’t know which one to choose. Danug was nearly a man. She thought she ought to take him, but something about Latie reminded Ayla of herself, and she remembered the look of longing she had seen on the girl’s face the first time Latie saw the horses.    “I think Whinney go faster if not too much weight. Danug is man,” Ayla said, giving him a big, warm smile. “I think Latie better this time.”    Danug nodded, looking flustered, and backed off, trying to find a way to deal with the sudden flush of mixed emotions that had unexpectedly overwhelmed him. He was sorely disappointed that Latie was chosen, but Ayla’s dazzling smile when she called him a man had caused the blood to rush to his face and his heart to beat faster—and an embarrassing tightening in his loins. 
AuelJM.txt	176	5.0	1985	Auel, Jean M	The Mammoth Hunters	  Another animal broke away, but Ayla managed to turn her around, too. Whinney seemed to know almost before the bison did which one would try next, but it was as much the woman’s unconscious signals to the horse as the mare’s intuitive sense that put her in the way of the shaggy animal. Ayla’s training of Whinney had not been a conscious effort in the beginning. The first time she got on the horse’s back had been sheer impulse, and no thought of controlling or directing entered her mind. It had happened gradually, as mutual understanding grew, and the control was exerted by tension of her legs and subtle shifts of her body. Though, eventually, she did begin to apply it purposefully, there was always an additional element of interaction between the woman and the horse, and they often moved as one, as though they shared one mind.    The instant Ayla moved, the others recognized the situation, and rushed to stop the herd. Ayla had chased herding animals with Whinney in the past, but she would not have been able to turn the bison around without help. The large humpbacked beasts were much harder to control than she imagined they would be. They’d been held back, and she had never tried to drive animals in a direction they didn’t want to go. It was almost as though some instinctual sense warned them of the trap waiting for them. 
AuelJM.txt	296	1.0	1985	Auel, Jean M	The Mammoth Hunters	  Jondalar’s forehead furrowed with concern. Too much attention from Doni was not necessarily desirable. He had been told often enough how well favored he was; it hadn’t brought him much happiness. Suddenly he remembered the words of the old white-haired Healer who had Served the Mother for the people of the Sharamudoi. The Shamud had told him once that the Mother favored him so much no woman could refuse him, not even the Mother Herself could refuse him—that was his gift—but warned him to be wary. Gifts from the Mother were not an unmixed blessing, they put one in Her debt. Did that mean Ayla was in Her debt?    Ayla wasn’t sure if she liked the last gift very much. “I not know Mother, or gifts. I think Cave Lion, my totem, send Whinney.”    Mamut looked surprised. “The Cave Lion is your totem?” Ayla noticed his expression, and recalled how difficult it had been for the Clan to believe that a female could have a powerful male totem protecting her. “Yes. Mog-ur told me. Cave Lion choose me, and make mark. I show you,” Ayla explained. She untied the waist thong of the legged garment, and lowered the flap enough to expose her left thigh, and the four parallel scars made by a sharp claw, evidence of her encounter with a cave lion.    The marks were old, long healed, Mamut noted. She must have been quite young. How had a young girl escaped from a cave lion? “How did you get that mark?” he asked. 
AuelJM.txt	496	3.0	1985	Auel, Jean M	The Mammoth Hunters	  Tulie examined it critically, at first judging it to be simplistic because it lacked the additional design, either carved or painted, that she was accustomed to. But as she looked more closely, running her fingertips over the remarkably smooth finish, noting the perfect shape and symmetry, she had to concede that it was certainly a finely crafted piece of work, perhaps the finest piece of workmanship of its kind she had ever seen. As the bowl was passed around, it aroused the interest and curiosity about the other gifts Ayla had brought even more as each person wondered if every gift would be as beautifully unusual.    Talut came forward next and gave Ayla a big hug, then presented her with an ivory-handled flint knife in a red-dyed rawhide sheath which was carved with an intricate design, similar to the knife Deegie wore on her belt. Ayla took the knife out of the sheath, and immediately guessed that the blade had probably been made by Wymez, and suspected that Ranec had carved and shaped the handle.    Ayla brought out a heavy pile of dark fur for Talut. He grinned wide when he shook out the mantle made from an entire bison hide, and flung it over his shoulders. The thick mane and shoulder fur made the big man seem even bigger than he was, and he enjoyed the effect. Then he noticed the way it clung to his shoulders and hung down in pliant folds, and examined the soft and supple inside of the warm cloak more closely. 
AuelJM.txt	642	2.0	1985	Auel, Jean M	The Mammoth Hunters	  “Yes. She’s out of season. And she’s a loner. That is why she was having so much trouble finding enough to eat. And why she came for the roast meat, and wanted the ermine so much. Look at her ribs. The pups have been taking a lot out of her. She’s hardly more than bones and fur. If she lived with a pack, they’d be helping her feed those pups, but if she lived with a pack, she would not have had pups. Only the female leader of a pack has pups, usually, and this wolf is the wrong color. Wolves get used to certain colors and marks. She’s like that white wolf I used to watch when I was learning about them. They didn’t like her either. She was always trying to make up to the female leader and the male leader, but they didn’t want her around. After the pack got so big, she left. Maybe she got tired of no one liking her.”    Ayla looked down at the black wolf. “Like this one did. Maybe that’s why she wanted to have pups, because she was lonely. But she shouldn’t have had them so early. I think this is the same black wolf I saw when we hunted bison, Deegie. She must have left her pack to look for a lone male to start her own pack, new packs get started that way. But it’s always hard on the loners.
AuelJM.txt	685	52560000.0	1985	Auel, Jean M	The Mammoth Hunters	  In a very real sense, it was a game, the very subtle and entirely serious game of comparative rank which is played by all social animals. It is the method by which individuals arrange themselves—horses in a herd, wolves in a pack, people in a community—so that they can live together. The game pits two opposing forces against each other, both equally important to survival: individual autonomy and community welfare. The object is to achieve dynamic equilibrium.    At times and under certain conditions individuals can be nearly autonomous. An individual can live alone and have no worry about rank, but no species can survive without interaction between individuals. The ultimate price would be more final than death. It would be extinction. On the other hand, complete individual subordination to the group is just as devastating. Life is neither static nor unchanging. With no individuality, there can be no change, no adaptation and, in an inherently changing world, any species unable to adapt is also doomed.    Humans in a community, whether it is as small as two people or as large as the world, and no matter what form the society takes, will arrange themselves according to some hierarchy. Commonly understood courtesies and customs can help to smooth the friction and ease the stress of maintaining a workable balance within this constantly changing system. In some situations most individuals will not have to compromise much of their personal independence for the welfare of the community. In others, the needs of the community may demand the utmost personal sacrifice of the individual, even to life itself. Neither is more right than the other, it depends on the circumstances; but neither extreme can be maintained for long, nor can a society last if a few people exercise their individuality at the expense of the community. 
AuelJM.txt	739	2.0	1985	Auel, Jean M	The Mammoth Hunters	  “This is the first child of my hearth, Fralie. Your baby, born to my hearth.” He kneeled beside the bed and held her hand. “This baby has to live. Tell me this baby will live,” he pleaded. “Fralie, tell me this baby will live.”    “I can’t tell you. I don’t know.” Her voice was strained and hoarse.    “I thought you knew about these things, Fralie. You’re a mother. You have two children already.”    “Each one is different,” she whispered. “This one has been difficult from the beginning. I was worried that I might lose it. There was so much trouble … finding a place to settle … I don’t know. I just think it’s too early for this baby to be born.”    “Why didn’t you tell me, Fralie?”    “What would you have done about it?” Crozie said, her tone restrained, almost hopeless. “What could you do? Do you know anything about pregnancy? Childbirth? Coughs? Pain? She didn’t want to tell you because you’ve done nothing but insult the one who could help her. Now the child will die, and I don’t know how weak Fralie is.”    Frebec turned to Crozie. “Fralie? Nothing can happen to Fralie! Can it? Women have babies all the time.”    “I don’t know, Frebec. Look at her, judge for yourself.”    Fralie was trying to control a cough that threatened, and the ache in her back was starting again. Her eyes were closed, and her brows drawn in. Her hair was tangled and stringy and her face shiny with sweat. Frebec jumped up and started to leave the hearth. “Where are you going, Frebec?” Fralie asked. 
AuelJM.txt	841	6.0	1985	Auel, Jean M	The Mammoth Hunters	  “Wolf! What are you doing here? Did you run away from Rydag?” she said, as the puppy jumped up on her in greeting, pleased and excited to have found her. Then he began sniffing around the area while she gathered up her things.    “Well, now that you’ve found me, we can go back. Come on, Wolf Let’s go. What are you after in those bushes … Jondalar!”    Ayla was stunned beyond words when she discovered what the young wolf had been after, and Jondalar was too embarrassed to speak, yet their eyes held, and spoke more than words could say. But they would not believe what they saw. Finally Jondalar attempted to explain.    “I was … uh … walking by, and … uh …”    He gave up, not even trying to finish his lame attempt at an excuse, turned and walked quickly away. Ayla followed him back toward the Camp more slowly, trudging up the slope toward the earthlodge. Jondalar’s behavior confused her. She wasn’t sure how long he had been there, but she knew he had been watching her, and wondered why he had been hiding from her. She didn’t know what to think, but as she went into the lodge through the annex to the Mammoth Hearth to find Mamut so he could complete her preparations, she remembered the way Jondalar had looked at her.

Without knowing it, tears were streaming down her face. Jondalar had carved it, in the valley. When he made it, he said he wanted to capture her spirit so they would never be apart. That was why he made it to resemble her, even though no one was supposed to make an image in the likeness of an actual person, for fear of trapping the spirit. He said he wanted her to have the carving, so no one could use it for malicious purposes against her. It was her first muta, she realized. He gave it to her after her First Rites, when he had made her a real woman.    She would never forget that summer in her valley, just the two of them, together. But Jondalar was going to leave without her. She clutched the ivory figure to her chest and wished she was going with him. Wolf was whimpering at her in sympathy, inching forward because he knew he was supposed to stay where he was. She reached for him, and buried her face in his fur, while he tried to lick away her salty tears. 
AuelJM.txt	1055	1440.0	1985	Auel, Jean M	The Mammoth Hunters	  What if I went back to the valley? And then brought Durc and Ura to live there? But Durc needs people … and so do I. I don’t want to live alone, why should Durc want to live alone in a valley with me?    I’ve been thinking of myself, not Durc. It would not be better for him to come here. It would not make him happy. It would only make me happy. But I am not Durc’s mother any more. Uba is his mother. I am nothing to him but a memory of a mother who died, and maybe it’s better that way. The Clan is his world, and like it or not, this is my world. I cannot go back to the Clan; Durc cannot come here. There is no place in this world where my son and I can live together, and be happy.    Ayla woke early the next morning. Even after she did finally go to sleep, she did not sleep well. She woke often from dreams of shaking earth and crumbling caves, and felt uneasy and depressed. She helped Nezzie heat water for soup and grind grains for a morning meal, and was glad for the opportunity to talk with her.    “I feel terrible about all the trouble I’ve caused, Nezzie. The whole Lion Camp is being shunned because of me,” Ayla said. 
AuelJM.txt	1187	30.0	1985	Auel, Jean M	The Mammoth Hunters	“I knew her destiny was with you from the beginning, and when the volcano erupted, I knew she would be leaving with you soon. But remember this. Ayla’s destiny is much greater than anyone knows. The Mother has chosen her, and her life will have many challenges, and so will yours. She will have need of your protection, and the strength your love has gained. That is why you had to learn that lesson. It is never easy to be chosen, but there are always great benefits, too. Take care of her, Jondalar. You know, when she worries about others, she forgets to take care of herself.”    Jondalar nodded. Then Ayla hugged the old man, smiling through dewy eyes.    “I wish Rydag were here. I miss him so much. I learned lessons, too. I wanted to go back for my son, but Rydag taught me that I must let Durc live his own life. How can I thank you for everything, Mamut?”    “No thanks are necessary, Ayla. Our paths were meant to cross. I have been waiting for you without knowing it, and you have given me much joy, my daughter. You were never meant to go back for Durc. He was your gift to the Clan. Children are always a joy, but pain, too. And they all must lead their own lives. Even Mut will let Her children go their own way, someday, but I fear for us if we ever neglect Her. If we forget to respect our Great Earth Mother, She will withhold Her blessings, and no longer provide for us.”    Ayla and Jondalar mounted the horses, waved, and said last goodbyes. Most of the encampment had come to wish them a good Journey. As they started out, Ayla kept looking for one last person. But Ranec had already said his goodbyes and he could not face a more public farewell. 
AuelJM.txt	1188	4.0	1985	Auel, Jean M	The Mammoth Hunters	  Ayla finally saw him when they started down the path, standing alone, off by himself. With a great heaviness of spirit, she stopped and waved to him.    Ranec waved back, but in his other hand he held clutched to his breast a piece of ivory, carved into the shape of a transcendent bird-woman figure. Into every notch that was carved, every line that was etched, he had lovingly carved every hope of his aesthetic and sensitive soul. He had made it for Ayla, hoping it would charm her to his hearth, as he hoped his laughing eyes and sparkling wit would charm her to his heart. But as the artist of great talent and charm and laughter watched the woman he loved ride away, no smile graced his face, and his laughing black eyes were filled with tears. 
ageofinnocence.txt	0	180.0	1920	Wharton, Edith	Age of Innocence	I.    On a January evening of the early seventies, Christine Nilsson was  singing in Faust at the Academy of Music in New York.    Though there was already talk of the erection, in remote metropolitan  distances "above the Forties," of a new Opera House which should  compete in costliness and splendour with those of the great European  capitals, the world of fashion was still content to reassemble every  winter in the shabby red and gold boxes of the sociable old Academy.  Conservatives cherished it for being small and inconvenient, and thus  keeping out the "new people" whom New York was beginning to dread and  yet be drawn to; and the sentimental clung to it for its historic  associations, and the musical for its excellent acoustics, always so  problematic a quality in halls built for the hearing of music.    It was Madame Nilsson's first appearance that winter, and what the  daily press had already learned to describe as "an exceptionally  brilliant audience" had gathered to hear her, transported through the  slippery, snowy streets in private broughams, in the spacious family  landau, or in the humbler but more convenient "Brown coupe." To come to  the Opera in a Brown coupe was almost as honourable a way of arriving  as in one's own carriage; and departure by the same means had the  immense advantage of enabling one (with a playful allusion to  democratic principles) to scramble into the first Brown conveyance in  the line, instead of waiting till the cold-and-gin congested nose of  one's own coachman gleamed under the portico of the Academy. It was  one of the great livery-stableman's most masterly intuitions to have  discovered that Americans want to get away from amusement even more  quickly than they want to get to it. 
ageofinnocence.txt	1	120.0	1920	Wharton, Edith	Age of Innocence	  When Newland Archer opened the door at the back of the club box the  curtain had just gone up on the garden scene. There was no reason why  the young man should not have come earlier, for he had dined at seven,  alone with his mother and sister, and had lingered afterward over a  cigar in the Gothic library with glazed black-walnut bookcases and  finial-topped chairs which was the only room in the house where Mrs.  Archer allowed smoking. But, in the first place, New York was a  metropolis, and perfectly aware that in metropolises it was "not the  thing" to arrive early at the opera; and what was or was not "the  thing" played a part as important in Newland Archer's New York as the  inscrutable totem terrors that had ruled the destinies of his  forefathers thousands of years ago.    The second reason for his delay was a personal one. He had dawdled  over his cigar because he was at heart a dilettante, and thinking over  a pleasure to come often gave him a subtler satisfaction than its  realisation. This was especially the case when the pleasure was a  delicate one, as his pleasures mostly were; and on this occasion the  moment he looked forward to was so rare and exquisite in quality  that--well, if he had timed his arrival in accord with the prima  donna's stage-manager he could not have entered the Academy at a more  significant moment than just as she was singing: "He loves me--he  loves me not--HE LOVES ME!--" and sprinkling the falling daisy petals  with notes as clear as dew. 
ageofinnocence.txt	19	1051200.0	1920	Wharton, Edith	Age of Innocence	  The question was: who was Beaufort? He passed for an Englishman, was  agreeable, handsome, ill-tempered, hospitable and witty. He had come  to America with letters of recommendation from old Mrs. Manson  Mingott's English son-in-law, the banker, and had speedily made himself  an important position in the world of affairs; but his habits were  dissipated, his tongue was bitter, his antecedents were mysterious; and  when Medora Manson announced her cousin's engagement to him it was felt  to be one more act of folly in poor Medora's long record of imprudences.    But folly is as often justified of her children as wisdom, and two  years after young Mrs. Beaufort's marriage it was admitted that she had  the most distinguished house in New York. No one knew exactly how the  miracle was accomplished. She was indolent, passive, the caustic even  called her dull; but dressed like an idol, hung with pearls, growing  younger and blonder and more beautiful each year, she throned in Mr.  Beaufort's heavy brown-stone palace, and drew all the world there  without lifting her jewelled little finger. The knowing people said it  was Beaufort himself who trained the servants, taught the chef new  dishes, told the gardeners what hot-house flowers to grow for the  dinner-table and the drawing-rooms, selected the guests, brewed the  after-dinner punch and dictated the little notes his wife wrote to her  friends. If he did, these domestic activities were privately  performed, and he presented to the world the appearance of a careless  and hospitable millionaire strolling into his own drawing-room with the  detachment of an invited guest, and saying: "My wife's gloxinias are a  marvel, aren't they? I believe she gets them out from Kew." 
ageofinnocence.txt	42	2.0	1920	Wharton, Edith	Age of Innocence	  "It's odd," Janey remarked, "that she should have kept such an ugly  name as Ellen. I should have changed it to Elaine." She glanced about  the table to see the effect of this.    Her brother laughed. "Why Elaine?"    "I don't know; it sounds more--more Polish," said Janey, blushing.    "It sounds more conspicuous; and that can hardly be what she wishes,"  said Mrs. Archer distantly.    "Why not?" broke in her son, growing suddenly argumentative. "Why  shouldn't she be conspicuous if she chooses? Why should she slink  about as if it were she who had disgraced herself? She's 'poor Ellen'  certainly, because she had the bad luck to make a wretched marriage;  but I don't see that that's a reason for hiding her head as if she were  the culprit."    "That, I suppose," said Mr. Jackson, speculatively, "is the line the  Mingotts mean to take."    The young man reddened. "I didn't have to wait for their cue, if  that's what you mean, sir. Madame Olenska has had an unhappy life:  that doesn't make her an outcast."    "There are rumours," began Mr. Jackson, glancing at Janey.    "Oh, I know: the secretary," the young man took him up. "Nonsense,  mother; Janey's grown-up. They say, don't they," he went on, "that the  secretary helped her to get away from her brute of a husband, who kept  her practically a prisoner? Well, what if he did? I hope there isn't  a man among us who wouldn't have done the same in such a case." 
ageofinnocence.txt	44	180.0	1920	Wharton, Edith	Age of Innocence	Jackson in an armchair near the fire in the Gothic library and handed  him a cigar. Mr. Jackson sank into the armchair with satisfaction, lit  his cigar with perfect confidence (it was Newland who bought them), and  stretching his thin old ankles to the coals, said: "You say the  secretary merely helped her to get away, my dear fellow? Well, he was  still helping her a year later, then; for somebody met 'em living at  Lausanne together."    Newland reddened. "Living together? Well, why not? Who had the right  to make her life over if she hadn't? I'm sick of the hypocrisy that  would bury alive a woman of her age if her husband prefers to live with  harlots."    He stopped and turned away angrily to light his cigar. "Women ought to  be free--as free as we are," he declared, making a discovery of which  he was too irritated to measure the terrific consequences.    Mr. Sillerton Jackson stretched his ankles nearer the coals and emitted  a sardonic whistle.    "Well," he said after a pause, "apparently Count Olenski takes your  view; for I never heard of his having lifted a finger to get his wife  back."        VI.    That evening, after Mr. Jackson had taken himself away, and the ladies  had retired to their chintz-curtained bedroom, Newland Archer mounted  thoughtfully to his own study. A vigilant hand had, as usual, kept the  fire alive and the lamp trimmed; and the room, with its rows and rows  of books, its bronze and steel statuettes of "The Fencers" on the  mantelpiece and its many photographs of famous pictures, looked  singularly home-like and welcoming. 
ageofinnocence.txt	70	2.0	1920	Wharton, Edith	Age of Innocence	  "How delightful! And you found it all out for yourselves--it was not  in the least arranged for you?"    Archer looked at her incredulously. "Have you forgotten," he asked  with a smile, "that in our country we don't allow our marriages to be  arranged for us?"    A dusky blush rose to her cheek, and he instantly regretted his words.    "Yes," she answered, "I'd forgotten. You must forgive me if I  sometimes make these mistakes. I don't always remember that everything  here is good that was--that was bad where I've come from." She looked  down at her Viennese fan of eagle feathers, and he saw that her lips  trembled.    "I'm so sorry," he said impulsively; "but you ARE among friends here,  you know."    "Yes--I know. Wherever I go I have that feeling. That's why I came  home. I want to forget everything else, to become a complete American  again, like the Mingotts and Wellands, and you and your delightful  mother, and all the other good people here tonight. Ah, here's May  arriving, and you will want to hurry away to her," she added, but  without moving; and her eyes turned back from the door to rest on the  young man's face.    The drawing-rooms were beginning to fill up with after-dinner guests,  and following Madame Olenska's glance Archer saw May Welland entering  with her mother. In her dress of white and silver, with a wreath of  silver blossoms in her hair, the tall girl looked like a Diana just  alight from the chase. 
ageofinnocence.txt	117	1.0	1920	Wharton, Edith	Age of Innocence	  She said the words "my husband" as if no sinister associations were  connected with them, and in a tone that seemed almost to sigh over the  lost delights of her married life. Archer looked at her perplexedly,  wondering if it were lightness or dissimulation that enabled her to  touch so easily on the past at the very moment when she was risking her  reputation in order to break with it.    "I do think," she went on, addressing both men, "that the imprevu adds  to one's enjoyment. It's perhaps a mistake to see the same people  every day."    "It's confoundedly dull, anyhow; New York is dying of dullness,"  Beaufort grumbled. "And when I try to liven it up for you, you go back  on me. Come--think better of it! Sunday is your last chance, for  Campanini leaves next week for Baltimore and Philadelphia; and I've a  private room, and a Steinway, and they'll sing all night for me."    "How delicious! May I think it over, and write to you tomorrow  morning?"    She spoke amiably, yet with the least hint of dismissal in her voice.  Beaufort evidently felt it, and being unused to dismissals, stood  staring at her with an obstinate line between his eyes.    "Why not now?"    "It's too serious a question to decide at this late hour."    "Do you call it late?"    She returned his glance coolly. "Yes; because I have still to talk  business with Mr. Archer for a little while." 
ageofinnocence.txt	118	2.0	1920	Wharton, Edith	Age of Innocence	  "Ah," Beaufort snapped. There was no appeal from her tone, and with a  slight shrug he recovered his composure, took her hand, which he kissed  with a practised air, and calling out from the threshold: "I say,  Newland, if you can persuade the Countess to stop in town of course  you're included in the supper," left the room with his heavy important  step.    For a moment Archer fancied that Mr. Letterblair must have told her of  his coming; but the irrelevance of her next remark made him change his  mind.    "You know painters, then? You live in their milieu?" she asked, her  eyes full of interest.    "Oh, not exactly. I don't know that the arts have a milieu here, any  of them; they're more like a very thinly settled outskirt."    "But you care for such things?"    "Immensely. When I'm in Paris or London I never miss an exhibition. I  try to keep up."    She looked down at the tip of the little satin boot that peeped from  her long draperies.    "I used to care immensely too: my life was full of such things. But  now I want to try not to."    "You want to try not to?"    "Yes: I want to cast off all my old life, to become just like everybody  else here."    Archer reddened. "You'll never be like everybody else," he said.    She raised her straight eyebrows a little. "Ah, don't say that. If  you knew how I hate to be different!" 
ageofinnocence.txt	123	1.0	1920	Wharton, Edith	Age of Innocence	  "Well, then: is it worth while to risk what may be infinitely  disagreeable and painful? Think of the newspapers--their vileness!  It's all stupid and narrow and unjust--but one can't make over society."    "No," she acquiesced; and her tone was so faint and desolate that he  felt a sudden remorse for his own hard thoughts.    "The individual, in such cases, is nearly always sacrificed to what is  supposed to be the collective interest: people cling to any convention  that keeps the family together--protects the children, if there are  any," he rambled on, pouring out all the stock phrases that rose to his  lips in his intense desire to cover over the ugly reality which her  silence seemed to have laid bare. Since she would not or could not say  the one word that would have cleared the air, his wish was not to let  her feel that he was trying to probe into her secret. Better keep on  the surface, in the prudent old New York way, than risk uncovering a  wound he could not heal.    "It's my business, you know," he went on, "to help you to see these  things as the people who are fondest of you see them. The Mingotts,  the Wellands, the van der Luydens, all your friends and relations: if I  didn't show you honestly how they judge such questions, it wouldn't be  fair of me, would it?" He spoke insistently, almost pleading with her  in his eagerness to cover up that yawning silence. 
ageofinnocence.txt	203	20160.0	1920	Wharton, Edith	Age of Innocence	  The idea of this monstrous exposure of her person was so painful to her  relations that they could have covered with gold the ingenious person  who suddenly discovered that the chair was too wide to pass between the  iron uprights of the awning which extended from the church door to the  curbstone. The idea of doing away with this awning, and revealing the  bride to the mob of dressmakers and newspaper reporters who stood  outside fighting to get near the joints of the canvas, exceeded even  old Catherine's courage, though for a moment she had weighed the  possibility. "Why, they might take a photograph of my child AND PUT IT  IN THE PAPERS!" Mrs. Welland exclaimed when her mother's last plan was  hinted to her; and from this unthinkable indecency the clan recoiled  with a collective shudder. The ancestress had had to give in; but her  concession was bought only by the promise that the wedding-breakfast  should take place under her roof, though (as the Washington Square  connection said) with the Wellands' house in easy reach it was hard to  have to make a special price with Brown to drive one to the other end  of nowhere.    Though all these transactions had been widely reported by the Jacksons  a sporting minority still clung to the belief that old Catherine would  appear in church, and there was a distinct lowering of the temperature  when she was found to have been replaced by her daughter-in-law. Mrs. 
ageofinnocence.txt	211	2.0	1920	Wharton, Edith	Age of Innocence	  Archer stared at the speaker so blankly that he repeated in still more  apologetic accents: "It'll be exactly the same, sir, I do assure  you--" and May's eager voice broke out, covering the embarrassed  silence: "The same as Rhinebeck? The Patroon's house? But it will be  a hundred thousand times better--won't it, Newland? It's too dear and  kind of Mr. van der Luyden to have thought of it."    And as they drove off, with the maid beside the coachman, and their  shining bridal bags on the seat before them, she went on excitedly:  "Only fancy, I've never been inside it--have you? The van der Luydens  show it to so few people. But they opened it for Ellen, it seems, and  she told me what a darling little place it was: she says it's the only  house she's seen in America that she could imagine being perfectly  happy in."    "Well--that's what we're going to be, isn't it?" cried her husband  gaily; and she answered with her boyish smile: "Ah, it's just our luck  beginning--the wonderful luck we're always going to have together!"        XX.    "Of course we must dine with Mrs. Carfry, dearest," Archer said; and  his wife looked at him with an anxious frown across the monumental  Britannia ware of their lodging house breakfast-table.    In all the rainy desert of autumnal London there were only two people  whom the Newland Archers knew; and these two they had sedulously  avoided, in conformity with the old New York tradition that it was not  "dignified" to force one's self on the notice of one's acquaintances in  foreign countries. 
ageofinnocence.txt	331	30.0	1920	Wharton, Edith	Age of Innocence	      XXX.    That evening when Archer came down before dinner he found the  drawing-room empty.    He and May were dining alone, all the family engagements having been  postponed since Mrs. Manson Mingott's illness; and as May was the more  punctual of the two he was surprised that she had not preceded him. He  knew that she was at home, for while he dressed he had heard her moving  about in her room; and he wondered what had delayed her.    He had fallen into the way of dwelling on such conjectures as a means  of tying his thoughts fast to reality. Sometimes he felt as if he had  found the clue to his father-in-law's absorption in trifles; perhaps  even Mr. Welland, long ago, had had escapes and visions, and had  conjured up all the hosts of domesticity to defend himself against them.    When May appeared he thought she looked tired. She had put on the  low-necked and tightly-laced dinner-dress which the Mingott ceremonial  exacted on the most informal occasions, and had built her fair hair  into its usual accumulated coils; and her face, in contrast, was wan  and almost faded. But she shone on him with her usual tenderness, and  her eyes had kept the blue dazzle of the day before.    "What became of you, dear?" she asked. "I was waiting at Granny's, and  Ellen came alone, and said she had dropped you on the way because you  had to rush off on business. There's nothing wrong?" 
ageofinnocence.txt	373	14400.0	1920	Wharton, Edith	Age of Innocence	  "Henry van der Luyden--Louisa--the Lovell Mingotts--the Reggie  Chiverses--Lawrence Lefferts and Gertrude--(yes, I suppose May was  right to have them)--the Selfridge Merrys, Sillerton Jackson, Van  Newland and his wife. (How time passes! It seems only yesterday that  he was your best man, Newland)--and Countess Olenska--yes, I think  that's all...."    Mrs. Welland surveyed her son-in-law affectionately. "No one can say,  Newland, that you and May are not giving Ellen a handsome send-off."    "Ah, well," said Mrs. Archer, "I understand May's wanting her cousin to  tell people abroad that we're not quite barbarians."    "I'm sure Ellen will appreciate it. She was to arrive this morning, I  believe. It will make a most charming last impression. The evening  before sailing is usually so dreary," Mrs. Welland cheerfully continued.    Archer turned toward the door, and his mother-in-law called to him:  "Do go in and have a peep at the table. And don't let May tire herself  too much." But he affected not to hear, and sprang up the stairs to  his library. The room looked at him like an alien countenance composed  into a polite grimace; and he perceived that it had been ruthlessly  "tidied," and prepared, by a judicious distribution of ash-trays and  cedar-wood boxes, for the gentlemen to smoke in.    "Ah, well," he thought, "it's not for long--" and he went on to his  dressing-room.    Ten days had passed since Madame Olenska's departure from New York. 
ageofinnocence.txt	410	14716800.0	1920	Wharton, Edith	Age of Innocence	  Archer had not seen M. Riviere, or heard of him, for nearly thirty  years; and that fact gave the measure of his ignorance of Madame  Olenska's existence. More than half a lifetime divided them, and she  had spent the long interval among people he did not know, in a society  he but faintly guessed at, in conditions he would never wholly  understand. During that time he had been living with his youthful  memory of her; but she had doubtless had other and more tangible  companionship. Perhaps she too had kept her memory of him as something  apart; but if she had, it must have been like a relic in a small dim  chapel, where there was not time to pray every day....    They had crossed the Place des Invalides, and were walking down one of  the thoroughfares flanking the building. It was a quiet quarter, after  all, in spite of its splendour and its history; and the fact gave one  an idea of the riches Paris had to draw on, since such scenes as this  were left to the few and the indifferent.    The day was fading into a soft sun-shot haze, pricked here and there by  a yellow electric light, and passers were rare in the little square  into which they had turned. Dallas stopped again, and looked up.    "It must be here," he said, slipping his arm through his father's with  a movement from which Archer's shyness did not shrink; and they stood  together looking up at the house. 
ageofinnocence.txt	412	5.0	1920	Wharton, Edith	Age of Innocence	Archer sat down on the bench and continued to gaze at the awninged balcony.  He calculated the time it would take his son to be carried up in the lift to the fifth floor, to ring the bell, and be admitted to the hall, and then ushered into the drawing-room.  He pictured Dallas entering that room with his quick assured step and his delightful smile, and wondered if the people were right who said that his boy "took after him." Then he tried to see the persons already in the room--for probably at that sociable hour there would be more than one--and among them a dark lady, pale and dark, who would look up quickly, half rise, and hold out a long thin hand with three rings on it....  He thought she would be sitting in a sofa-corner near the fire, with azaleas banked behind her on a table. "It's more real to me here than if I went up," he suddenly heard himself say; and the fear lest that last shadow of reality should lose its edge kept him rooted to his seat as the minutes succeeded each other.
ageofinnocence.txt	413	30.0	1920	Wharton, Edith	Age of Innocence	  He sat for a long time on the bench in the thickening dusk, his eyes  never turning from the balcony. At length a light shone through the  windows, and a moment later a man-servant came out on the balcony, drew  up the awnings, and closed the shutters.    At that, as if it had been the signal he waited for, Newland Archer got  up slowly and walked back alone to his hotel.   
MitcMG.txt	0	120.0	1936	Mitchell, Margaret	Gone With the Wind	      PART ONE            Chapter One      SCARLETT O’HARA WAS NOT BEAUTIFUL, but men seldom realized it when caught by her charm as the Tarleton twins were. In her face were too sharply blended the delicate features of her mother, a Coast aristocrat of French descent, and the heavy ones of her florid Irish father. But it was an arresting face, pointed of chin, square of jaw. Her eyes were pale green without a touch of hazel, starred with bristly black lashes and slightly tilted at the ends. Above them, her thick black brows slanted upward, cutting a startling oblique line in her magnolia-white skin—that skin so prized by Southern women and so carefully guarded with bonnets, veils and mittens against hot Georgia suns.    Seated with Stuart and Brent Tarleton in the cool shade of the porch of Tara, her father’s plantation, that bright April afternoon of 1861, she made a pretty picture. Her new green flowered-muslin dress spread its twelve yards of billowing material over her hoops and exactly matched the flat-heeled green morocco slippers her father had recently brought her from Atlanta. The dress set off to perfection the seventeen-inch waist, the smallest in three counties, and the tightly fitting basque showed breasts well matured for her sixteen years. But for all the modesty of her spreading skirts, the demureness of hair netted smoothly into a chignon and the quietness of small white hands folded in her lap, her true self was poorly concealed. The green eyes in the carefully sweet face were turbulent, willful, lusty with life, distinctly at variance with her decorous demeanor. Her manners had been imposed upon her by her mother’s gentle admonitions and the sterner discipline of her mammy; her eyes were her own. 
MitcMG.txt	1	1.0	1936	Mitchell, Margaret	Gone With the Wind	  On either side of her, the twins lounged easily in their chairs, squinting at the sunlight through tall mint-garnished glasses as they laughed and talked, their long legs, booted to the knee and thick with saddle muscles, crossed negligently. Nineteen years old, six feet two inches tall, long of bone and hard of muscle, with sunburned faces and deep auburn hair, their eyes merry and arrogant, their bodies clothed in identical blue coats and mustard-colored breeches, they were as much alike as two bolls of cotton.    Outside, the late afternoon sun slanted down in the yard, throwing into gleaming brightness the dogwood trees that were solid masses of white blossoms against the background of new green. The twins’ horses were hitched in the driveway, big animals, red as their masters’ hair; and around the horses’ legs quarreled the pack of lean, nervous possum hounds that accompanied Stuart and Brent wherever they went. A little aloof, as became an aristocrat, lay a black-spotted carriage dog, muzzle on paws, patiently waiting for the boys to go home to supper.    Between the hounds and the horses and the twins there was a kinship deeper than that of their constant companionship. They were all healthy, thoughtless young animals, sleek, graceful, high-spirited, the boys as mettlesome as the horses they rode, mettlesome and dangerous but, withal, sweet-tempered to those who knew how to handle them. 
MitcMG.txt	51	2.0	1936	Mitchell, Margaret	Gone With the Wind	  “Is it a spectacle you’ve been making of yourself—of all of us?” he bawled, his voice rising as always in moments of excitement. “Have you been running after a man who’s not in love with you, when you could have any of the bucks in the County?”    Anger and hurt pride drove out some of the pain.    “I haven’t been running after him. It—it just surprised me.”    “It’s lying you are!” said Gerald, and then, peering at her stricken face, he added in a burst of kindliness: “I’m sorry, daughter. But after all, you are nothing but a child and there’s lots of other beaux.”    “Mother was only fifteen when she married you, and I’m sixteen,” said Scarlett, her voice muffled.    “Your mother was different,” said Gerald. “She was never flighty like you. Now come, daughter, cheer up, and I’ll take you to Charleston next week to visit your Aunt Eulalie and, what with all the hullabaloo they are having over there about Fort Sumter, you’ll be forgetting about Ashley in a week.”    “He thinks I’m a child,” thought Scarlett, grief and rage choking utterance, “and he’s only got to dangle a new toy and I’ll forget my bumps.”    “Now, don’t be jerking your chin at me,” warned Gerald. “If you had any sense you’d have married Stuart or Brent Tarleton long ago. Think it over, daughter. Marry one of the twins and then the plantations will run together and Jim Tarleton and I will build you a fine house, right where they join, in that big pine grove and—”    “Will you stop treating me like a child!” cried Scarlett. “I don’t want to go to Charleston or have a house or marry the twins. I only want—” She caught herself but not in time. 
MitcMG.txt	91	80640.0	1936	Mitchell, Margaret	Gone With the Wind	  The house had been built according to no architectural plan whatever, with extra rooms added where and when it seemed convenient, but, with Ellen’s care and attention, it gained a charm that made up for its lack of design. The avenue of cedars leading from the main road to the house—that avenue of cedars without which no Georgia planter’s home could be complete—had a cool dark shadiness that gave a brighter tinge, by contrast, to the green of the other trees. The wisteria tumbling over the verandas showed bright against the whitewashed brick, and it joined with the pink crêpe myrtle bushes by the door and the white-blossomed magnolias in the yard to disguise some of the awkward lines of the house.    In springtime and summer, the Bermuda grass and clover on the lawn became emerald, so enticing an emerald that it presented an irresistible temptation to the flocks of turkeys and white geese that were supposed to roam only the regions in the rear of the house. The elders of the flocks continually led stealthy advances into the front yard, lured on by the green of the grass and the luscious promise of the cape jessamine buds and the zinnia beds. Against their depredations, a small black sentinel was stationed on the front porch. Armed with a ragged towel, the little negro boy sitting on the steps was part of the picture of Tara—and an unhappy one, for he was forbidden to chunk the fowls and could only flap the towel at them and shoo them. 
MitcMG.txt	109	5.0	1936	Mitchell, Margaret	Gone With the Wind	  When she had finished her prayers for those beneath the roof of Tara, her father, mother, sisters, three dead babies and “all the poor souls in Purgatory,” she clasped her white beads between long fingers and began the Rosary. Like the rushing of a soft wind, the responses from black throats and white throats rolled back:    “Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now, and at the hour of our death.”    Despite her heartache and the pain of unshed tears, a deep sense of quiet and peace fell upon Scarlett as it always did at this hour. Some of the disappointment of the day and dread of the morrow departed from her, leaving a feeling of hope. It was not the lifting up of her heart to God that brought this balm, for religion went no more than lip deep with her. It was the sight of her mother’s serene face upturned to the throne of God and His saints and angels, praying for blessings on those whom she loved. When Ellen intervened with Heaven, Scarlett felt certain that Heaven heard.    Ellen finished and Gerald, who could never find his beads at prayer time, began furtively counting his decade on his fingers. As his voice droned on, Scarlett’s thoughts strayed, in spite of herself. She knew she should be examining her conscience. Ellen had taught her that at the end of each day it was her duty to examine her conscience thoroughly, to admit her numerous faults and pray to God for forgiveness and strength never to repeat them. But Scarlett was examining her heart. 
MitcMG.txt	332	240.0	1936	Mitchell, Margaret	Gone With the Wind	  She went back toward her father with the reviving liquor, thanking Heaven that the famous O’Hara head had not been able to survive last night’s bout and wondering suddenly if Rhett Butler had had anything to do with that.            Chapter Eleven      ON AN AFTERNOON OF THE FOLLOWING WEEK, Scarlett came home from the hospital weary and indignant. She was tired from standing on her feet all morning and irritable because Mrs. Merriwether had scolded her sharply for sitting on a soldier’s bed while she dressed his wounded arm. Aunt Pitty and Melanie, bonneted in their best, were on the porch with Wade and Prissy, ready for their weekly round of calls. Scarlett asked to be excused from accompanying them and went upstairs to her room.    When the last sound of carriage wheels had died away and she knew the family was safely out of sight, she slipped quietly into Melanie’s room and turned the key in the lock. It was a prim, virginal little room and it lay still and warm in the slanting rays of the four-o’clock sun. The floors were glistening and bare except for a few bright rag rugs, and the white walls unornamented save for one corner which Melanie had fitted up as a shrine. 
MitcMG.txt	516	109440.0	1936	Mitchell, Margaret	Gone With the Wind	  The state militia who had gone out so short a time before, resplendent in new uniforms, could hardly be distinguished from the seasoned troops, so dirty and unkempt were they. There was a new look in their eyes. Three years of apologizing, of explaining why they were not at the front was behind them now. They had traded security behind the lines for the hardships of battle. Many of their number had traded easy living for hard death. They were veterans now, veterans of brief service, but veterans just the same, and they had acquitted themselves well. They searched out the faces of friends in the crowd and stared at them proudly, defiantly. They could hold up their heads now.    The old men and boys of the Home Guard marched by, the graybeards almost too weary to lift their feet, the boys wearing the faces of tired children, confronted too early with adult problems. Scarlett caught sight of Phil Meade and hardly recognized him, so black was his face with powder and grime, so taut with strain and weariness. Uncle Henry went limping by, hatless in the rain, his head stuck through a hole in a piece of old oilcloth. Grandpa Merriwether rode in on a gun carriage, his bare feet tied in quilt scraps. But search though she might, she saw no sign of John Wilkes. 
MitcMG.txt	652	1.5	1936	Mitchell, Margaret	Gone With the Wind	  From the wagon the faint wailing sounded again and Gerald seemed to rouse himself with an effort.    “It’s Melanie and her baby,” whispered Scarlett rapidly. “She’s very ill—I brought her home.”    Gerald dropped his hand from her arm and straightened his shoulders. As he moved slowly to the side of the wagon, there was a ghostly semblance of the old host of Tara welcoming guests, as if Gerald spoke words from out of shadowy memory.    “Cousin Melanie!”    Melanie’s voice murmured indistinctly.    “Cousin Melanie, this is your home. Twelve Oaks is burned. You must stay with us.”    Thoughts of Melanie’s prolonged suffering spurred Scarlett to action. The present was with her again, the necessity of laying Melanie and her child on a soft bed and doing those small things for her that could be done.    “She must be carried. She can’t walk.”    There was a scuffle of feet and a dark figure emerged from the cave of the front hall. Pork ran down the steps.    “Miss Scarlett! Miss Scarlett!” he cried.    Scarlett caught him by the arms. Pork, part and parcel of Tara, as dear as the bricks and the cool corridors! She felt his tears stream down on her hands as he patted her clumsily, crying: “Sho is glad you back! Sho is—”    Prissy burst into tears and incoherent mumblings: “Poke! Poke, honey!” And little Wade, encouraged by the weakness of his elders, began sniffling: “Wade thirsty!”    Scarlett caught them all in hand. 
MitcMG.txt	754	1.7	1936	Mitchell, Margaret	Gone With the Wind	  “By God, I’ll give these damn Rebels something to remember me by,” shouted the private finally when the sergeant, losing his good nature, told him to go to hell and not talk back. The little man went charging toward the back of the house and Scarlett breathed more easily. They had said nothing about burning the house. They hadn’t told her to leave so they could fire it. Perhaps—perhaps—The men came rambling into the hall from the upstairs and the out of doors.    “Anything?” questioned the sergeant.    “One hog and a few chickens and ducks.”    “Some corn and a few yams and beans. That wildcat we saw on the horse must have given the alarm, all right.”    “Regular Paul Revere, eh?”    “Well, there ain’t much here, Sarge. You got the pickin’s. Let’s move on before the whole country gets the news we’re comin’.”    “Didja dig under the smokehouse? They generally buries things there.”    “Ain’t no smokehouse.”    “Didja dig in the nigger cabins?”    “Nothin’ but cotton in the cabins. We set fire to it.”    For a brief instant Scarlett saw the long hot days in the cotton field, felt again the terrible ache in her back, the raw bruised flesh of her shoulders. All for nothing. The cotton was gone.    “You ain’t got much, for a fac’, have you, lady?”    “Your army has been here before,” she said coolly. 
MitcMG.txt	1101	5.0	1936	Mitchell, Margaret	Gone With the Wind	  Scarlett thought: What damnably queer people Yankees are! Those women seemed to think that because Uncle Peter was black, he had no ears to hear with and no feelings, as tender as their own, to be hurt. They did not know that negroes had to be handled gently, as though they were children, directed, praised, petted, scolded. They didn’t understand negroes or the relations between the negroes and their former masters. Yet they had fought a war to free them. And having freed them, they didn’t want to have anything to do with them, except to use them to terrorize Southerners. They didn’t like them, didn’t trust them, didn’t understand them, and yet their constant cry was that Southerners didn’t know how to get along with them.    Not trust a darky! Scarlett trusted them far more than most white people, certainly more than she trusted any Yankee. There were qualities of loyalty and tirelessness and love in them that no strain could break, no money could buy. She thought of the faithful few who remained at Tara in the face of the Yankee invasion when they could have fled or joined the troops for lives of leisure. But they had stayed. She thought of Dilcey toiling in the cotton fields beside her, of Pork risking his life in neighboring hen houses that the family might eat, of Mammy coming to Atlanta with her to keep her from doing wrong. She thought of the servants of her neighbors who had stood loyally beside their white owners, protecting their mistresses while the men were at the front, refugeeing with them through the terrors of the war, nursing the wounded, burying the dead, comforting the bereaved, working, begging, stealing to keep food on the tables. And even now, with the Freedmen’s Bureau promising all manner of wonders, they still stuck with their white folks and worked much harder than they ever worked in slave times. But the Yankees didn’t understand these things and would never understand them. 
MitcMG.txt	1208	50400.0	1936	Mitchell, Margaret	Gone With the Wind	  “And they are going to pull up the weeds. The hell of it is Dolly said I’d be only too pleased to help do it, ’cause I didn’t have anything much else to do. I got nothing against the Yankees and I think Miss Melly was right and the rest of those lady wild cats wrong. But the idea of me pulling weeds at my time of life and with my lumbago!”    Melanie was on the board of lady managers of the Orphans’ Home and assisted in the collection of books for the newly formed Young Men’s Library Association. Even the Thespians who gave amateur plays once a month clamored for her. She was too timid to appear behind the kerosene-lamp footlights, but she could make costumes out of croker sacks if they were the only material available. It was she who cast the deciding vote at the Shakespeare Reading Circle that the bard’s works should be varied with those of Mr. Dickens and Mr. Bulwer-Lytton and not the poems of Lord Byron, as had been suggested by a young and, Melanie privately feared, very fast bachelor member of the Circle. 
MitcMG.txt	1456	11520.0	1936	Mitchell, Margaret	Gone With the Wind	  Even before Scarlett was able to be about again, she noticed Rhett’s preoccupation with the baby and was somewhat nettled and embarrassed at his pride in her in front of callers. It was all very well for a man to love his child but she felt there was something unmanly in the display of such love. He should be offhand and careless, as other men were.    “You are making a fool of yourself,” she said irritably, “and I don’t see why.”    “No? Well, you wouldn’t. The reason is that she’s the first person who’s ever belonged utterly to me.”    “She belongs to me, too.”    “No, you have two other children. She’s mine.”    “Great balls of fire!” said Scarlett. “I had the baby, didn’t I? Besides honey, I belong to you.”    Rhett looked at her over the black head of the child and smiled oddly.    “Do you, my dear?”    Only the entrance of Melanie stopped one of those swift hot quarrels which seemed to spring up so easily between them these days. Scarlett swallowed her wrath and watched Melanie take the baby. The name agreed upon for the child was Eugenie Victoria, but that afternoon Melanie unwittingly bestowed a name that clung, even as “Pittypat” had blotted out all memory of Sarah Jane. 
MitcMG.txt	1518	30.0	1936	Mitchell, Margaret	Gone With the Wind	  After a long time, he knocked on her door and she said, trying to control her voice: “Come in.”    “Am I actually being invited into the sanctuary?” he questioned, opening the door. It was dark and she could not see his face. Nor could she make anything of his voice. He entered and closed the door.    “Are you ready for the reception?”    “I’m so sorry but I have a headache.” How odd that her voice sounded natural! Thank God for the dark! “I don’t believe I’ll go. You go, Rhett, and give Melanie my regrets.”    There was a long pause and he spoke drawlingly, bitingly in the dark.    “What a white livered, cowardly little bitch you are.”    He knew! She lay shaking, unable to speak. She heard him fumble in the dark, strike a match and the room sprang into light. He walked over to the bed and looked down at her. She saw that he was in evening clothes.    “Get up,” he said and there was nothing in his voice. “We are going to the reception. You will have to hurry.”    “Oh, Rhett, I can’t. You see—”    “I can see. Get up.”    “Rhett, did Archie dare—”    “Archie dared. A very brave man, Archie.”    “You should have killed him for telling lies—”    “I have a strange way of not killing people who tell the truth. There’s no time to argue now. Get up.”    She sat up, hugging her wrapper close to her, her eyes searching his face. It was dark and impassive. 
MitcMG.txt	1633	1.2	1936	Mitchell, Margaret	Gone With the Wind	You kin talk ter Mist’ Rhett an’ maybe he lissen ter you. He set a gret sto’ by you, Miss Melly. Maybe you doan know it, but he do. Ah done hear him say time an’ agin, you is de onlies’ gret lady he knows.”    “But—”    Melanie rose to her feet, confused, her heart quailing at the thought of confronting Rhett. The thought of arguing with a man as grief crazed as the one Mammy depicted made her go cold. The thought of entering that brightly lighted room where lay the little girl she loved so much wrung her heart. What could she do? What could she say to Rhett that would ease his grief and bring him back to reason? For a moment she stood irresolute and through the closed door came the sound of her boy’s treble laughter. Like a cold knife in her heart came the thought of him dead. Suppose her Beau were lying upstairs, his little body cold and still, his merry laughter hushed.    “Oh,” she cried aloud, in fright, and in her mind she clutched him close to her heart. She knew how Rhett felt. If Beau were dead, how could she put him away, alone with the wind and the rain and the darkness?    “Oh! Poor, poor Captain Butler!” she cried. “I’ll go to him now, right away.”    She sped back to the dining room, said a few soft words to Ashley and surprised her little boy by hugging him close to her and kissing his blond curls passionately. 
MitcMG.txt	1696	10.0	1936	Mitchell, Margaret	Gone With the Wind	  She had never understood either of the men she had loved and so she had lost them both. Now, she had a fumbling knowledge that, had she ever understood Ashley, she would never have loved him; had she ever understood Rhett, she would never have lost him. She wondered forlornly if she had ever really understood anyone in the world.    There was a merciful dullness in her mind now, a dullness that she knew from long experience would soon give way to sharp pain, even as severed tissues, shocked by the surgeon’s knife, have a brief instant of insensibility before their agony begins.    “I won’t think of it now,” she thought grimly, summoning up her old charm. “I’ll go crazy if I think about losing him now. I’ll think of it tomorrow.”    “But,” cried her heart, casting aside the charm and beginning to ache, “I can’t let him go! There must be some way!”    “I won’t think of it now,” she said again, aloud, trying to push her misery to the back of her mind, trying to find some bulwark against the rising tide of pain. “I’ll—why, I’ll go home to Tara tomorrow,” and her spirits lifted faintly. 
MitcMG.txt	1697	5.0	1936	Mitchell, Margaret	Gone With the Wind	  She had gone back to Tara once in fear and defeat and she had emerged from its sheltering walls strong and armed for victory. What she had done once, some-how—please God, she could do again! How, she did not know. She did not want to think of that now. All she wanted was a breathing space in which to hurt, a quiet place to lick her wounds, a haven in which to plan her campaign. She thought of Tara and it was as if a gentle cool hand were stealing over her heart. She could see the white house gleaming welcome to her through the reddening autumn leaves, feel the quiet hush of the country twilight coming down over her like a benediction, feel the dews falling on the acres of green bushes starred with fleecy white, see the raw color of the red earth and the dismal dark beauty of the pines on the rolling hills.    She felt vaguely comforted, strengthened by the picture, and some of her hurt and frantic regret was pushed from the top of her mind. She stood for a moment remembering small things, the avenue of dark cedars leading to Tara, the banks of cape jessamine bushes, vivid green against the white walls, the fluttering white curtains. And Mammy would be there. Suddenly she wanted Mammy desperately, as she had wanted her when she was a little girl, wanted the broad bosom on which to lay her head, the gnarled black hand on her hair. Mammy, the last link with the old days.    With the spirit of her people who would not know defeat, even when it stared them in the face, she raised her chin. She could get Rhett back. She knew she could. There had never been a man she couldn’t get, once she set her mind upon him.    “I’ll think of it all tomorrow, at Tara. I can stand it then. Tomorrow, I’ll think of some way to get him back. After all, tomorrow is another day.”
