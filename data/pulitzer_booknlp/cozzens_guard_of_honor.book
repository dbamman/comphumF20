He wanted to have it wrong , so he 'd have something to sulk about . Now , no one blames Bus for what happened . Given the situation that exists , it , or something like it , must happen from time to time . Where does Bus come in ? He did n't cause the situation to exist . Is the Old Man , the War Department , or anyone else , going to hold Bus strictly accountable for the facts that Southern whites feel that Negroes can not be allowed social or political equality ; or that Negroes do n't enjoy being treated like animals ?

Bus is not expected to do the impossible ; he is not expected to reverse himself , humiliate himself . He is expected to act , as far as other duties and responsibilities allow him , to smooth it over , not stir it up . I do n't think there 's any difference of opinion between us on that , Judge .

There 's you , and there 's Pop ; and you know him and you work for him and you go to bat for him . And if you will , other people will . They did ; they have . The Old Man knows that . A man ca n't do everything himself -- not if what he 's doing amounts to much . Up to a point , yes ; but then how much other people will do for him is very important . '' ","i":180981},{"w":"`` I think the Old Man has it in mind to give Bus the Tactical Air Force for the invasion of the Japanese home islands ; if and when . It would not be inappropriate . The AAF would n't mind cutting itself a little piece of that ` I shall return ' stuff . '' ","i":181258},{"w":"`` Bus got his second star and was pulled out a little before the African business was over and sent to England . Then the Old Man changed his mind . I think I know why . Bus was insisting he be allowed to fly the escort missions himself . He was always flying missions in Africa , you know . Of course , some operations he needed to see first-hand -RCB- and leading missions , especially in the early days , was good for morale -RCB- only Bus did it all the time . He seems to like it . The Old Man did n't want him doing it all the time over Germany . We ca n't afford to lose what Bus knows , on the chance that he might get to know a little bit more . It puts too much at stake -RCB- it 's not a reasonable risk . And , anyway , when the Old Man says something , that 's it . Believe me . You do n't go on insisting on things . '' ","i":181547},{"w":"`` So it seemed a good idea to have Bus home , stop fighting the whole war with him , give him a chance to cool off . Moreover , he was just what they wanted for AFORAD , Ocanara , here . He certainly knew about operational requirements ; so everything fitted in nicely . I know the Old Man had a talk with Bus , and Bus was satisfied . I imagine the idea is for Bus to hold this down until we go ashore in Europe . Then , shoot him over to that Tactical Air Force -- not in any command capacity ; but to observe how the air-ground co-operation works out . As soon as we get into Germany , Bus would be pulled out and brought right home to start the fighter organization for the Japanese business . That 's what I think is in the cards , Judge . Or could be . '' ","i":181738},{"w":"`` Judge , it would n't be good to suggest that Bus ought to have some leave , go off for a few weeks . They would want a reason . Keep remembering that Washington has all the troubles it needs -- I know nobody in the field ever thinks so -- and things could also add up on them , if they let them . They could get in a state , too ; except the Old Man wo n't have it . Nobody can be allowed to make himself a worry . Colonel Woodman was an example of that . He was about to get the ax , you know . I suppose you could say little things had been adding up on him , and he let himself get into a state . Sellers Field was relatively unimportant , and Training Command Headquarters stood between Woodman and Washington , at least until Woodman did some funny business out of channels . In short , they do n't like to hear that somebody needs a rest . It 's always bad news in their business . '' ","i":182555},{"w":"`` Double up there to the intersection !

The bar has been instructed by Major Seely , the Club Officer , to refuse service to project personnel . When those who have asked for service are refused , I want your man to explain to them that the facilities of this Club are for permanent party personnel only .

As soon as they find out what they 're assembled for , as soon as they hear the order , they 'll know that we know what they were planning .

The order just read has nothing to do with that . General Beal states in the order his reason for putting AFORAD facilities , other than those named , off limits . The use of them , along with permanent party personnel having no connection with your group , would work against the development of that group spirit which it is one of the most important objects of this project to inculcate .

Unless a woman wants him to get into all kinds of trouble , she has no business to leave him for months and months . I did n't leave you for months and months , you may remember .

Every cocktail lounge in Washington was full of them , picking up girls and drinking , if not actually too much , more than they were used to . If you remember what they looked like , you 'll agree that no woman who was really fond of a man could let him make such a spectacle of himself . And it would be a case of her letting him .

Though I am sure Bus does n't know this , I am also sure that nothing flatters him so much as to have Benny accept him as an equal , talk back to him , disobey him sometimes . That way , he knows Benny respects him . I think Benny does , too . I think Bus is one of the very few people Benny has any use for . They make sense to each other .

You ca n't do anything with people ; I have been trying all day . I think Colonel Mowbray is a good man , and he is the biggest fool I know . We are having a little trouble with some Negro officers . They feel they are unjustly treated . I think in many ways they are ; but there are insurmountable difficulties in doing them justice . The only people who stood up for them were two offensive young fellows , I think principally interested in showing off , in making themselves felt . I really saw nobody all day who was not in one way or another odious .

Willis , Army Air Forces , piloting a B-Twenty-six medium bomber in company with two others on a routine cross-country training flight , found his scheduled return to base delayed by adverse weather conditions . In overcoming these conditions all three planes were obliged to use most of their fuel . Because of the distance to the nearest suitable air field , and the rugged desert country over which they were flying , no landing appeared possible ; and a proposal to bail out was made . However , Lieutenant Willis , with less than fifteen-minutes fuel in his tanks , located on the map and accurately led the flight to a small auxiliary field intended for the use of light planes only .

He puts it to you that certain things are self-evident -RCB- and he puts it to you so strongly that you feel , in light of them , you and he have common aims , plans . After that has worked on you awhile , he might show you that among the chief obstacles to your common plan was you yourself . You might find that really he was right ; and if you did , you might have to help him see what could be done about removing you . I think he would be quite grave and friendly . You would not dislike him . '' ","i":197709},{"w":"`` That was not quite it , Cora . I said I was partial to a man who can isolate an issue and plead to it . I think he isolates the issue , winning the war , with great clarity . I do n't say he had any brilliant thoughts about it ; just that he can disentangle facts from impressions . He does n't let himself be confused by accidentals -- because a thing is big , or because it is small . He commented on one big thing -- problems at the Quebec Conference ; and one small one -- the disciplinary 438 difficulty which I mentioned to you last night , about some colored officers . His thought in both cases was that you will not do what you can not do . Do you find the thought impressive ? '' ","i":197972},{"w":"`` If you 'll confront our condition instead of your theory , you 'll see . This is how he can be one and not the other . For reasons of justice and decency ; and also for reasons of political policy , the War Department decided that colored men must be given a chance to qualify as officers . We have about a thousand of them in the Air Force . In the Air Force , we have now somewhere around three hundred thousand white officers . A certain number of these , I do n't know how many , but in relation to the whole , a proportion infinitely larger than that of colored to white officers , an unmanageably large number , hold that a nigger is a nigger . They will not have anything to do with him socially . That is their decision , inculcated in them from their first conscious moments , handed down to them with the sanctions of use and interest . I do n't say this could n't be changed , or that it wo n't ever be ; but it wo n't change today , tomorrow , this week . A man can not choose to see what he can not see .

Benny , as Bus once remarked to me , is just Benny . My dear , you still confront the theory . What the majority wants makes a great difference . That big majority may feel that a Negro is a human being all right ; but when you add that they want to see him treated fairly , you 're wrong . That is not the condition . The condition is that the big majority does n't mind if he 's treated fairly , a very different thing . The big majority does not want him to marry their sister . The big majority does not want to insult or oppress him ; but the big majority has , in general , a poor opinion of him . It gets awfully fed up with these colored girls .

Lieutenant Kashkin advised him that he was prepared to use force if necessary ; but he hoped Lieutenant Edsell would not make it necessary . Edsell then made a movement to brush by Lieutenant Kashkin , and Lieutenant Kashkin took his arm , restraining him .

I suppose you heard , before you left , about this little difficulty this morning , that Negro newspaper fellow raising the fuss . Now , that man was entirely in the wrong ; and I was surprised to hear any attention was paid his telegram . As Graham Jobson must have told you , he should never have been sent here .

They take this entirely false and misleading telegram that James sends the Air Forces Group and take action on that . They use that as a basis to intervene in a purely local thing , a little personnel difficulty which we were already acting on and had under control . Bus did n't say this , you understand -RCB- but I 'm saying it because I 'm pretty sure I know how Bus felt , how he naturally would feel .

There was some slip-up in distribution in Headquarters . I wrote it . I put in what you did n't like -- the separate Officers Club . Bus had nothing to do with it . In my judgment , it was absolutely necessary . If Bus is in trouble about that , I want you to be able to tell them how it happened -- whose error in judgment it really was .

A colored boy may have the same legal rights as anyone else , and we can see nobody takes those away from him ; at least , where we have control . We ca n't impose him on the community , on Ocanara , for instance . In Ocanara , there is n't a hotel used by white people which would dream of letting a Negro register ; there is n't a restaurant used by white people that would serve him a meal . I do n't think you 'd suggest we try to change that . In short , you know better than to insist that the municipality of Ocanara stop segregating Negroes socially .

But it was still his responsibility to make sure about other traffic before he put down . He should have gone around again . It was n't his fault , no thanks to him , he did n't kill Bus and you and all the rest of them . That 's what made Benny sore , and you know as well as I do , that that 's why Benny hit him .
