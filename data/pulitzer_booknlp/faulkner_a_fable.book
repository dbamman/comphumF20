Then he wants them to start it up again so we will be willing to bet him twenty shillings a month that we will be dead in thirty days . Which is what they are going to do -- start it up again . You all saw those four aeroplanes yesterday , and all that archie . The archie were blank shells . There was a German general in the hun aeroplane . Last night he was at Chaulnesmont . He would have to have been ; else , why did he come at all ? why else wafted across on a cloud of blank archie shell , with three S.E. 5S going through the motion of shooting him down with blank ammunition ? Oh yes , I was there ; I saw the lorries fetching up the shells night before last , and yesterday I stood behind one of the batteries firing them when one of the S.E. 's -- that pilot would have been a child of course , too young for them to have dared inform him in advance , too young to be risked with the knowledge that fact and truth are not the same -- dived and put a burst rigjrt into the battery and shot me in the skirt of my tunic with something -- whatever it was -- which actually stung a little for a moment . What else , except to allow a German general to visit the French and the British and the American ones in the Allied Commandery-in-Chief without alarming the rest of us bipeds who were not born generals but simply human beings ? And since they -- all four of them -- would speak the same language , no matter what clumsy isolated national tongues they were compelled by circumstance to do it in , the matter probably took them no time at all and very likely the German one is already on his way back home at this moment , not even needing the blank shells now because the guns will be already loaded with live ones , merely waiting for him to get out of the way in order to resume , efface , obliterate forever this ghastly and incredible contretemps . So we have no time , you see . We may not even have an hour . But an hour will be enough , if only it is all of us , the whole battalion . Not to kill the officers ; they themselves have abolished killing for a recess of three days . Besides , we wont need to , with all of us . If we had time , we could even draw lots : one man to each officer , to simply hold his hands while the rest of us go over . But the flat of a pistol is quicker and no more harmful really , as Mr Smith and Sergeant Bledsoe and Horn will tell you when they awake .
