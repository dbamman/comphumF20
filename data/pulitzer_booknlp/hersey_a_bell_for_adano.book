He said that killing two Germans helped rather than hurt Italy -LRB- perhaps , as things have turned out , we should have killed more -RRB- and that the best thing we could do would be to preserve ourselves for our country 's next battle .

These men had only been in one battle , but they were crazy with fear , and also with the wine . One of them would get up and shout : To hell with the son of a frog , Mussolini !
