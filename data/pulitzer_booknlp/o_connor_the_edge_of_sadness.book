It 's endless , Hugh . Endless , endless , endless . My day is spent in listening to one continuous supplicating whine . I know everything they 're going to say before they open their mouths : over and over again , the same troubles I 've heard for thirty years , the same complaints , the same banalities , the same gossip , the same trivialities , and if you 're foolish enough to respond , to actually offer the advice they claim they need so badly , they almost go crazy with impatience . Because you 've interrupted them ; they have n't finished complaining : ` Yes yes , Father , that 's true , that 's very true , but there 's one thing more , there 's one thing more I 've got to tell you ... ' There 's always one thing more . Every day . The same old whimpers and whispers and groans and tears from people who ca n't manage their own lives and who can hardly wait to bolt down their breakfasts before rushing up to the rectory to tell me they ca n't . And it 's all nonsense ; it means nothing . I 'm a priest , not a wastebasket . These people who every morning sing to themselves , ` Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag and take them up to Father ' -- I want them for once , just once , to stay at home . Or at least to stop talking . To shut up . That 's all . Just for a while . Because I 'm tired , Hugh . Dead tired . Worn thin . It ca n't go on this way . '' ","i":180267},{"w":"`` No , I suppose not . Probably no more than there always were . What 's different , Hugh , is that there seem to be more . And I mind them more .

It 's all fairly elementary pastoral theology , is n't it ? We all know what we 're supposed to do : the shepherd-flock relationship . But , Hugh , what if the shepherd knows all this , what if he understands exactly what his duties are , what if he realizes that in a very special way this flock is his responsibility and nobody 's but his , and that it is in fact the only reason he 's where he is and what he is -- what if he knows all this and tells himself all this at half-past seven every morning , just after he 's finished saying Mass , just after thirty minutes of proclaim-ing -- quite honestly , he thinks at the time -- his own love of God , and what if he comes out of the side door of the church with every good intention in the world and suddenly he meets that flock in person ? What if , then and there , he sees some old biddy streaking down the street towards him , her jaws already working , or he sees some poor old slob with his hat in his hand hanging around , waiting , outside the rectory door -- what if the shepherd sees this and suddenly his stomach turns and all he can feel for his beloved flock is a total , overwhelming disgust ! Not apathy , not indifference , but disgust . Disgust for the whole whispering , confiding , sordid , sniveling lot ! That 's what the truth is , Hugh ! It 's not simply , as my father has so pleasantly broadcast to anyone who would listen , that I 'm a ` cold proposition ' ; it 's more than coldness now . It 's that I can no longer stand the sight of them ! They make me sick ! '' ","i":181301},{"w":"`` No . Stay there , Hugh . Please . I just have to leave for a minute . I 'll be right back . Stay right there . '' ","i":182506},{"w":"`` is n't that really the one kind of parish you want ? Do n't answer because I know the answer : I know you , Hugh . And I knew what you wanted that day I saw you at my father 's birthday party -- just as I knew it today when you walked into the rectory . It stands out , it shines out , all over you : you want to come back , you 're homesick . And homesick for what ? I 'll tell you for what : a dream , a never-never land . You 're a sentimental man , Hugh : a romantic . Whether you know it or not , you live in the past : you feed on memories . You think of the world as it was -- or as you think it was -- before anything happened to you : before your father died , before you drank . The pre-catastrophic world of Father Hugh Kennedy -- the happy time . To which , one day , you hope to return . You do want to come back , do n't you , Hugh ? It 's impossible , but you want to do it anyway . You want to come back here , to Saint Raymond 's , to Saint Stephen 's , to anywhere -- so long as you 're with your own . Back to where everybody in the parish says ` Hello there , Father ! ' and you wo n't be lonely any more . Back to where they all stop on the street for a friendly word because after all you 're one of them , they know you , and they knew your father before you . Back to the old crowd , Hugh : back to the Backbone of the Church . Is n't that what they 're called ? Or is it only what they call themselves ? I 've forgotten , and it 's no matter anyway . My own feelings towards that famous Backbone are well enough known ; there 's no need for one more sneer from a disaffected pastor . But disaffected or not , at least I do n't see them through a ridiculous puddle of moonbeams , and if I 'm all wrong as a priest for wanting to get away from them as fast as I can , is it any less wrong for a priest to want to be with them so much that he dreams his hours away thinking only of The Great Day When ? And meanwhile neglecting his present parishioners , not even knowing who they are and not wanting to know ? Is n't there an extraordinary snobbism here -- and is n't the priest who 's guilty of it in some danger of confusing that celebrated Backbone with the whole blessed Church ? We were talking a minute ago about the differences between us , Hugh , but I 'll tell you what the real difference is . It 's that I may have turned my back on my parish , but you 've never even turned your face on yours . You do n't even know it 's there . And so what does it all boil down to ? Just this : that you do n't do your job , either . Only you do n't do yours in a slightly different way . That 's all .
